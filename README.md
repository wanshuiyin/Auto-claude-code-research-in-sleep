🌱 *ARIS is a methodology, not a platform. What matters is the research workflow — take it wherever you go.*

🤖 **AI agents:** Read [`AGENT_GUIDE.md`](AGENT_GUIDE.md) instead — structured for LLM consumption, not human browsing.

🛡️ **ARIS audits its own output → now [Anti-Autoresearch](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Anti-Autoresearch) audits everyone's.** It catalogs **46 integrity hack-patterns across 8 families (A–H), plus 13 zero-verdict-weight AI-style impressions and 2 advisory signals — 61 signals total** — and checks a submission for them **end-to-end**, producing a deterministic, reviewer-ready integrity report. *Self-consistency + fabrication forensics, **not** an AI-text detector.*

<p align="center"><em>The field has put up with unreliable autoresearch long enough —<br>Anti-Autoresearch is the read that finally catches it.</em></p>

🎬 **ARIS goes multimodal → [ARIS-Movie-Director](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/ARIS-Movie-Director)** — hand over a fuzzy story, wake up to a **cross-model-audited movie** (reference run = 19 scenes). Long-horizon visual stories drift two ways (🧠 **long-range forgetting** · 🗣️ each frame **signed off by the model that drew it**); ARIS answers with the same DNA — a **research-wiki** for memory + **multi-agent debate** so *no frame signs off on itself*.

> **v0.4.21** (2026-06-28) — **bug-fix patch**: 5 new user-facing bugs from a Codex adversarial hunt (all disk-verified, distinct from v0.4.20), each cross-model reviewed at a design gate and an implementation gate (gpt-5.5 xhigh; both started NO-GO — the reviewer caught an off-by-one in the grep line-mapping and a missing stream-level test before GO). **🐛 Headline**: OpenAI-compatible streaming corrupted multi-byte UTF-8 (CJK / emoji) split across network chunks into `�` — each HTTP body chunk was `from_utf8_lossy`'d independently, so a 3-byte Chinese character or 4-byte emoji straddling a chunk boundary broke on both sides (a frequent hit for Chinese users on domestic OpenAI-compatible providers — Kimi/GLM/MiniMax/DeepSeek/Qwen/Doubao — streaming Chinese text); the stream buffer is now raw bytes, decoding only complete SSE lines. **A saved OpenAI/custom executor config no longer overrides a shell-set `EXECUTOR_PROVIDER`** — the startup "shell-provided vars win" path had one ungated write that re-pointed `EXECUTOR_PROVIDER=anthropic … aris …` to OpenAI (wrong executor / model-not-found). **An Anthropic stream truncated after content but before a terminal signal now hard-errors** (`premature_eof`) instead of saving a half-finished answer to history as a complete turn (symmetric to the OpenAI `#249` guard; the `stop_reason`-only compat path is preserved, and `ARIS_ALLOW_EOF_WITHOUT_STOP=1` opts a terminal-signal-less proxy back into the old behavior). **`grep_search` with `multiline: true`** now matches across lines in content mode (was silently empty — `count` mode already worked). **MCP tool results carried only in `structuredContent`** (empty `content`) are no longer dropped — the model gets the JSON structured payload. Tests (CI mode): api 32→35 / runtime 205→212 / tools 67 / aris-cli 172→181 / commands 5 (+21, incl. 2 stream-level integration tests), all green. Codex MCP (gpt-5.5 xhigh): design gate (NO-GO → GO after fixing the off-by-one) → implementation gate (NO-GO → GO after adding the stream-level integration tests); the Anthropic streaming spec (every stream ends with `message_stop`) was WebFetch-verified. Two latent-only candidates (Anthropic block-`index` routing, OpenAI multi-line SSE) remain deferred.
>
> **v0.4.20** (2026-06-19) — **bug-fix patch**: 7 user-facing bugs surfaced by a Codex adversarial hunt, each reviewed across 3 rounds (the reviewer caught a redraw gap, a trailing-blank, a spinner tail, and a blank-line edge before GO). **🐛 Headline ([#299](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/299))**: short REPL replies showed only "✔ Done" — the spinner draws "⠋ Thinking…" with Save/RestorePosition so streamed output overwrites it on the same line, but `finish` then cleared that whole line, **erasing a short single-line reply**. The REPL now finishes without clearing when the turn printed visible text (`Clear(UntilNewLine)` wipes only the spinner tail after the reply). **Streamed multi-paragraph replies rendered glued** ("para1para2") — each chunk's paragraph separator was trimmed at the stream boundary; the markdown streamer now preserves separators via a held-separator so streamed output equals a single full render (no dangling blank line). **Markdown tables with CJK/fullwidth content misaligned** — width now counts display cells (CJK = 2), not chars. **`aris "prompt"` / `--print` ignored the executor model saved by `aris setup`** (REPL-only before) — a configured OpenAI/custom executor got the Anthropic default sent to its endpoint; the one-shot and REPL paths now share one resolver. **Esc** now actually closes the completion dropdown (it was recomputed right back). **`glob_search`** reports the total matched count when truncated (not the capped 100, which made the model think a 1000-match glob had 100 files). **`/model`'s custom menu** reads the effective env the executor uses, not stale on-disk config. Tests (CI mode): api 32 / runtime 205 / tools 67 / aris-cli 172 / commands 5, all green; +7 new; real-machine verified (short reply renders + "✔ Done"; paragraphs keep their blank lines). Codex MCP (gpt-5.5 xhigh): hunt → 3 review rounds (NO-GO → NO-GO → GO). Two latent-only candidates (Anthropic block-`index` routing, OpenAI multi-line SSE) deferred to a hardening pass.
>
> **v0.4.19** (2026-06-14) — **honesty / guardrails patch** (theme from a Codex fresh-eyes audit; no behavior change for healthy setups). **🔴 MCP protocol-version negotiation guard** — the stdio handshake requested `2025-03-26` but never read the version the server negotiated back (a parsed-but-dead field), so a server agreeing on a version ARIS can't speak was silently accepted and later `tools/list` / `tools/call` ran on an incompatible protocol with opaque failures. ARIS now validates the negotiated version against a supported set (`2025-11-25` / `2025-06-18` / `2025-03-26` / `2024-11-05` — stdio framing is identical across these) and, on an unsupported one, terminates the child + clears the slot + surfaces a clear per-server error (`aris doctor` shows it) — the "terminate when versions can't be agreed" behavior the MCP lifecycle spec requires. The *request* stays `2025-03-26` (proven against `codex mcp-server`), so healthy servers are unaffected — verified end-to-end: the real Codex MCP server still spawns + initializes + advertises its tools under the guard. **🧹 Papercuts**: the OpenAI-family subagent fail-loud message dropped its stale "lands in v0.4.18" marker (now version-agnostic + actionable, still credential-free); OpenAI upstream error bodies are now truncated (500 chars) + credential-redacted (`sk-…` keys and `Bearer …` tokens, via a substring scanner that catches the compact-JSON shape `{"api_key":"sk-…"}` a misconfigured proxy can reflect back) instead of splatted verbatim; the system-prompt hook-events summary now counts only the hooks the runtime actually executes (a `command` hook with a `command` string), matching the parser. Tests (CI mode): api 32 / runtime 204 / tools 67 / aris-cli 167 / commands 5, all green; live smoke confirms the real Codex MCP server still initializes under the guard. Reviewed by Codex MCP (gpt-5.5 xhigh): design GO → impl NO-GO (compact-secret miss + command-string strictness) → GO after fixes.

> **v0.4.18** (2026-06-14) — **default model → Claude Opus 4.8**, with corrected pricing and a safety net. The bump moves `DEFAULT_MODEL`, the `opus` alias, the model picker, `aris setup`, and the subagent default to `claude-opus-4-8` — with an **availability fallback**: if the account lacks 4.8 (the API returns `404 not_found_error`), ARIS auto-falls-back to `claude-opus-4-7` for the session, **rebuilds the system-prompt model identity so it stays coherent** (the model is never told it's 4.8 while served 4.7), warns once, and retries — for the main session (text + JSON) and subagents. It fires only on that precise 404 (never 400/rate-limit/auth), latches against loops, and the text path rebuilds from a pre-turn snapshot so a retry never double-appends the user message; accounts **with** 4.8 are byte-identical to a plain bump. **💰 Pricing corrected** (verified against Anthropic's published schedule; had been a 3–5× over-estimate): current **Opus 4.5–4.8 = `$5/$25`** (deprecated Opus 4/4.1 keep `$15/$75`, split by word-boundary so a future `opus-4-10` isn't mis-tiered); **Sonnet 4.x = `$3/$15`** (decoupled from the generic unknown-model fallback, which stays `$15/$75`); Haiku was already correct. **🧹 Backlog**: `aris setup` option 10 pins the Codex MCP reviewer to `model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"` (deterministic for new setups, independent of `~/.codex/config.toml`; idempotent merge never clobbers an existing entry); a startup + `aris doctor` **misconfig hint** ([#259](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/259)) for a silently-ignored/misplaced config (malformed JSON, or a stray `~/.aris/config.yaml` — stderr-only so `--print`/JSON stdout stays clean); the system-prompt hook summary now marks parsed-but-never-fired events **"PARSED ONLY … will NOT run"** instead of implying dead hooks run (full event expansion — actually firing `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd`/… — deferred to a separate issue). Tests (CI mode): api 32 / runtime 202 / tools 67 / aris-cli 166 / commands 5, all green; a live one-shot smoke returns `model=claude-opus-4-8` end-to-end. Reviewed by Codex MCP (gpt-5.5 xhigh) across the design + both implementation batches (design REWORK→GO, impl NO-GO→GO, batch-2 GO).
>
> **v0.4.17** (2026-06-13) — **the MCP release.** Before v0.4.17, `mcpServers` in `settings.json` parsed, showed in `aris doctor`, and did *nothing*; now ARIS spawns each configured stdio server, runs the MCP handshake, discovers tools, and advertises them as `mcp__<server>__<tool>` on **both** provider paths (Anthropic + OpenAI-family), with end-to-end dispatch, soft per-server degradation, and an approval gate for untrusted MCP tools (external processes the sandbox can't cover; `--allowedTools` now accepts `mcp__` names). **🆕 zero-API-key cross-model reviewer**: `aris setup` → **option 10 (Codex MCP, ChatGPT subscription, no API key)** writes an idempotent `mcpServers.codex` entry into the settings file the runtime actually reads (atomic write + backup, explicit consent before `trust: true`), with an optional API reviewer as **fallback** (`ARIS_REVIEWER_PROVIDER=codex-mcp` + `ARIS_REVIEWER_FALLBACK_PROVIDER`); `/setup` in-REPL rebuilds the system prompt + runtime so reviewer changes take effect without quitting. **🔴 Protocol fix the fakes couldn't catch**: real-machine e2e against `codex mcp-server` exposed that our stdio transport spoke LSP-style `Content-Length:` framing while the MCP spec (and codex) use **newline-delimited JSON-RPC** — every fake-server test passed because the fakes spoke the same wrong dialect; writes are now NDJSON, reads auto-detect both, and the spec-mandated `notifications/initialized` is sent after `initialize` (a select-based round-trip also closes the [#286](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/286) large-request deadlock). **Hooks**: object-style Claude Code hooks preserve `matcher` / `timeout` / `async` (anchored-regex matcher filtering; per-hook timeout, default 30 s kill = warning not deny). **Long tail**: `ARIS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN` gate, Anthropic `stop_reason` clean-EOF symmetry (CL2), OpenAI tool-call `index`-missing merge-by-id (OE6), slash commands enter history. **Real-machine push-gate hardening** (the zero-key reviewer's first run): codex `codex/event` notification spam silenced by default (gated behind `ARIS_MCP_STDERR=inherit`), the system prompt now tells the model **not** to pass a `model` parameter to Codex (account default = gpt-5.5 + xhigh; arbitrary names are rejected by a ChatGPT account), and a Codex-MCP-primary-with-no-fallback `LlmReview` call returns a clear "use `mcp__codex__codex`" message instead of a misleading `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`gpt-5.5` error. Built with the v0.4.16 zero-regression methodology (24 new characterization tests; every deliberate flip annotated in-place). Tests (CI mode): runtime 199 / aris-cli 165 / tools 67 / api 30 / commands 5, all green. Reviewed phase-by-phase by Codex MCP (gpt-5.5 xhigh) across 17 rounds (7 NO-GOs all resolved). Subagent MCP routing (P8) + MCP `protocolVersion` bump + hook `async` execution deferred to v0.4.18.
>
> **v0.4.16** (2026-05-30) — REPL UX + provider hardening, shipped under a zero-regression discipline: 64 characterization ("golden") tests locked the *current* provider-routing / pricing / reviewer / subagent / REPL behavior first, then stayed green through every change. Closes [#274](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/274): command history now persists to `~/.config/aris/history` (0600) and reloads on startup, with an `ARIS_NO_HISTORY` kill-switch and a disk-only secret-skip (credential-looking lines stay in in-session history but never touch disk); bash-style **Ctrl+R** reverse incremental search (CJK display-width-aware single-line render; no existing key binding changed; no new dependency). Security: an OpenAI-family main session (Kimi / GLM / MiniMax / …) spawning a subagent previously **silently billed the user's Anthropic OAuth/Keychain credential** — it now fails loud with a clear, credential-free error; full OpenAI-family subagent routing is a cross-crate change deferred to v0.4.17. Groundwork (no behavior change): the 3 byte-identical word-boundary matchers consolidate into one canonical `runtime::word_match`; new pure `ProviderFamily` classifier (unwired). Tests (CI mode): runtime 164 / aris-cli 128 / tools 49 / commands 5, all green. Codex MCP (gpt-5.5 xhigh) reviewed each phase + a final integration pass.
>
> **v0.4.15** (2026-05-29) — OpenAI-compatible streaming robustness hotfix. Closes [#249](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/249): MiniMax (and other OpenAI-compatible providers / proxies) were effectively unusable because the clean-EOF completion check treated the `data: [DONE]` SSE sentinel as the *only* authoritative signal. A non-empty `choices[].finish_reason` is the Chat Completions spec's terminal-chunk marker; `[DONE]` is a transport convention some compatible providers never emit (MiniMax sends `finish_reason: "stop"` then closes without `[DONE]`). The clean-EOF decision is now a pure, unit-tested `stream_eof_action(...)` that completes on EITHER `[DONE]` OR a non-empty `finish_reason`; reads are NOT stopped early at finish_reason (a trailing `include_usage` usage-only chunk is still consumed), genuine truncation still hard-errors, and a pre-output proxy abort still restarts. Coupled fixes: **OE7** reads finish_reason before the `delta` guard (delta-less terminal choice); **OE2** flushes pending tool calls on any non-empty finish_reason; **OE4** surfaces a mid-stream error envelope as a hard error instead of silently dropping it; **OE3** tolerates `data:{...}` without the space after the colon. +5 unit tests (77→82) extract the previously-untested SSE completion logic into pure helpers. Anthropic SSE path untouched. Codex MCP (gpt-5.5 xhigh) 3 rounds (GO-WITH-NITS → GO-WITH-NITS → GO).

> **v0.4.14** (2026-05-25) — Security-hygiene release closing the top items from the v0.4.13 codex audit (gpt-5.5 xhigh, 6/10 NEEDS-REWORK verdict). **🔴 S9 (P0) system-prompt config redaction** — before v0.4.14, `render_config_section()` dumped the merged `settings.json` verbatim into the system prompt sent to the LLM provider, leaking `env`, `mcpServers.<name>.headers.Authorization` Bearer tokens, hook command env, signed-URL query params, and `apiKey` fields. New renderer whitelists top-level fields (`model`/`permissionMode`/`theme`/`outputStyle`/`permissions`/`sandbox` with recursive redaction inside), redacts sensitive keys (`apikey`/`token`/`secret`/`password`/`authorization`/`headers`/`env`/`_KEY`/`_SECRET`/`_TOKEN`), replaces MCP `command` with `<configured>` placeholder, reduces MCP `url` to strict `<scheme://host[:port]>` origin (scheme allow-list `http`/`https`/`ws`/`wss`, ASCII host, digit-only port, IPv6 brackets), and drops hook command strings entirely. Regression test exercises 9 distinct leak surfaces; URL parser has its own targeted test for 7 smuggling attempts including port-position secret injection (codex round-3 catch). **🟡 P9 (P1)**: DeepSeek `aris --help` now points at `aris setup` option 7 instead of an env-var path the resolver never honored. **🟡 M1/M2 (P1) doc**: `aris doctor` + README/README_CN gain experimental warning whenever `mcpServers.len() > 0` (full MCP tool dispatch lands v0.4.16). **🟢 C11 (P2) stream idle timeout** — both Anthropic `MessageStream` and the OpenAI SSE loop wrap `response.chunk().await` in `tokio::time::timeout` (env `ARIS_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 120, clamp `[10, 1800]`, 0/negative disables); closes the "aris hangs forever with no output" symptom when an upstream HTTPS proxy holds a connection without keepalives. **Bundle**: 77 skills (+1 `/wiki-enrich` via late same-day sync to main `7e3ab67` which also picks up upstream `check_ready.sh` awk + grep-c null-match fix), 54 helpers. Codex MCP 6 rounds (NO-GO + 4 → GO-WITH-NITS + 3 → NO-GO + port smuggling → GO → release metadata GO → sync GO).
>
> **v0.4.13** (2026-05-25) — Residue-cleanup release closing every codex audit P1 carried since v0.4.10–v0.4.12, plus the long-tail regression tests. **🟡 v0.4.10 P1.D per-server MCP timeout** — `mcpServers.<name>.requestTimeoutSecs` override > `MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` env > 300s default (clamped 1..=1800), so one Codex MCP agent can run 5 min while filesystem MCP errors in 5 s. **🟡 v0.4.10 known limitation closed** — `McpStdioProcess::request()` skips JSON-RPC notifications (id absent/null) and keeps reading until the correlated response. **🟢 meta_opt hook deploy via `aris init`** — `tools/meta_opt/{log_event,check_ready}.sh` bundle into the binary; `aris init` writes ARIS-namespaced **`aris-meta-opt-log-event.sh`** / **`aris-meta-opt-check-ready.sh`** to `~/.claude/hooks/` (codex round-1 #1: never clobbers user hooks); settings.json merge idempotent, backups hard-fail, final rewrite atomic via tempfile + rename. **🧪 9 v0.4.12 targeted regression tests** for sandbox.strictMode (3) + parse strictMode + provider_match pricing + has_word o-series + stream_options 400 + meaningful-content classification + premature-EOF retry truth table (codex round-1 #3 — `should_retry_on_premature_eof()` extracted to pure fn, 7-row test). **Bundle**: 76 skills, **54 helpers** (+2 meta_opt scripts vs v0.4.12). Codex 3 rounds (NO-GO + 3 → NO-GO + metadata → GO).
>
> **v0.4.12** (2026-05-22) — Bug-fix + small-feature release. **#238 `sandbox.strictMode`** opt-in config key; when set, `SandboxConfig::resolve_request()` ignores all five LLM-supplied overrides (`dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, `namespaceRestrictions`, `isolateNetwork`, `filesystemMode`, `allowedMounts`) — closes the gap where a tool call could silently bypass user sandbox policy. `aris doctor` adds a "Sandbox:" row; bash tool schema documents the strictMode semantics. **#232** `auto-review-loop-llm` updated from legacy `deepseek-chat` / `deepseek-reasoner` (deprecate 2026-07-24; reasoner rejects `tool_choice`) to `deepseek-v4-flash` / `deepseek-v4-pro`. **v0.4.10 audit P1 follow-ups**: P1.A Anthropic stream retry gates on `has_emitted_meaningful_content` (a stream that only sent `MessageStart` before EOF is retry-eligible); P1.B `supports_reasoning_effort` + reviewer mirror use word-boundary match so `openai/o3-mini` / `proxy:o4` route correctly; P1.C `stream_options.include_usage:true` proxy fallback retries once without on real 400 unknown-field errors; P2 pricing match precision via `provider_match()` so `qwen3.6-plus` / `kimi-k2.5` route correctly while `my-kimi-clone` does not. **Skills sync** (76 skills, 52 helpers): `/interview-cheatsheet` + `/render-html` newly bundled; `build.rs` `ALLOWED_EXTS` gains `html` for render-html templates; `EXCLUDED_SKILL_PREFIXES` → `starts_with("skills-codex")`. **CI fetch-depth: 0** + origin/main fetch so drift-test ancestor check runs. Cross-reviewed by Codex MCP (gpt-5.5 xhigh) over 4 rounds.
>
> **v0.4.11** (2026-05-18) — Skills bundle refresh + sync infrastructure. The embedded skills set in the v0.4.10 binary had fallen behind main (~6 of 56 main `skills/` commits had been cherry-picked); v0.4.11 syncs the full set and ships sync infrastructure so the gap can't silently reopen. Bundle: 65→74 user-facing skills, 34→49 helper resources. 10 new skills bundled: `/citation-audit` (fourth-layer bibliography audit), `/experiment-queue` (SSH multi-seed job queue with OOM retry), `/kill-argument` (two-thread adversarial review for theory papers), `/resubmit-pipeline` (W5: text-only port to a new venue), `/paper-talk` (end-to-end conference talk pipeline), `/slides-polish` (per-page Codex layout review), `/overleaf-sync` (two-way Overleaf Git-bridge), `/gemini-search` + `/openalex` (broader literature sources), `/qzcli` (Qizhi GPU jobs). 46 existing SKILL.md refreshed — most critically the canonical resolver chain rollout (closes real user incident where `/research-wiki` was empty for a week from hardcoded `tools/research_wiki.py`), submission assurance gate + external verifier (`/paper-writing` Phase 6 now functions). tools/ goes 9→18: 9 baseline helpers refreshed (`research_wiki.py` 315→767 lines with canonical `ingest_paper` API), 9 new helpers (`extract_paper_style.py`, `figure_renderer.py`, `paper_illustration_image2.py`, `overleaf_{setup,audit}.sh`, `verify_wiki_coverage.sh`, `watchdog.py`, `experiment_queue/{build_manifest,queue_manager}.py`). New `tools/sync_main_skills.sh` automates main → bundle rsync with symlink pre-flight + codex-mirror prune + `SKILLS_SOURCE_COMMIT` pinning. 3 new CI drift tests in `crates/runtime/src/cache.rs` cover all 4 resolver layer patterns. Gemini MCP calls in `/research-lit` and `/gemini-search` now pass `model: 'auto-gemini-3'` (avoids silent downgrade to 2.5-pro on OAuth-personal capacity exhaustion). CLI runtime unchanged — codex-audit P1 follow-ups remain on v0.4.12 backlog. Cross-reviewed by Codex MCP (gpt-5.5 xhigh) across 5 rounds (REQUEST CHANGES → APPROVE WITH NITS → NO-GO → GO → final GO).
>
> **v0.4.10** (2026-05-17) — Stream + MCP reliability + multi-provider pricing. C6 whole-stream restart in Anthropic `MessageStream` + OpenAI SSE loop on chunk decode failure / premature EOF (`ARIS_STREAM_RETRY`, default 2, clamp 0..=5, fires only when nothing emitted yet — closes [#228](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/228)-style "error decoding response body" loop). M3 MCP stdio gains 300s default `tokio::time::timeout` over send+read (override `MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`, clamp 1..=1800); `response.id ↔ request.id` correlation; `ensure_server_ready()` `try_wait()` dead-process respawn; `kill().await` on all failure paths so the next call starts clean (closes [#151](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/151) / [#172](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/172) "Calling codex..." stalls). C8/P4 OpenAI streaming requests now send `stream_options.include_usage:true` + parse `cached_tokens`; Anthropic streaming merges `MessageStart.usage` (input/cache) with `MessageDelta.usage` (output). C9 multi-provider pricing registry (15+ models, OpenAI cache_read = input × 0.1 corrects 5× generic overstatement, DeepSeek cache_hit/cache_miss tiers, `has_word()` boundary matcher for `provider/<model>` slugs). 9 dead-code warnings cleared; `aris setup` help text synced with actual behaviour.
>
> **v0.4.9** (2026-05-17) — Closes Codex v0.4.7 audit residuals (L1 TLS double-stack, L3 reasoning_cache compaction misalign, L4 reasoning replay unbounded). 2 new skills bundled (`/figure-spec` + `/paper-illustration-image2` with `scripts/` subdirs, new Layer 0b = `$ARIS_CACHE_DIR/skills/<name>/scripts/`); `research_wiki.py` promoted to shared `tools/` (9+ callers); 5 more SKILL.md migrated to fallback chain.
>
> **v0.4.8** (2026-05-17) — Skill helper subsystem rewrite. Bundled helpers extract to `~/.config/aris/cache/<version>/` at startup; every Skill invocation surfaces `helperReport` JSON + 4-layer resolver preamble; `/skills export` copies helpers; new `integration-contract.md` with 6 failure policies; 8 shared helpers (arxiv/deepxiv/exa/S2/openalex/save_trace/verify_papers/verify_paper_audits) bundled; `/research-lit` + `/deepxiv` migrated. Plus 4 bug fixes: gpt-5.5+tools 400 on OpenAI; Custom reviewer reset; missing `signature` field ([#228](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/228)); `--version` Build date hardcoded.
>
> **v0.4.7** (2026-05-16) — DashScope Coding Plan 405 fixed ([#159](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/159)) via `native-tls` switch ([#225](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/225)); `reasoning_content` replay for all reasoning models (OpenAI o1/o3/o4 / DeepSeek-R1 etc.), not just Kimi ([#226](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/226)); 600+ lines dead code cleanup + `rustyline` dep removed + "Claw Code" → "ARIS-Code" rebrand.
>
> **v0.4.6** (2026-05-14) — 🚨 Two long-standing silent bugs fixed: `PermissionMode::Prompt` silently allowed every tool (derived-`Ord` bug); system prompt hardcoded `current_date = "2026-03-31"` made models reject post-cutoff data as future/prompt-injection. Plus Custom OpenAI-compatible provider (`/setup` option 11) with dynamic `/models` discovery ([@Anduin9527](https://github.com/Anduin9527) [#221](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/221) + [#222](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/222)).
>
> **v0.4.5** (2026-05-13) — First-class reasoning-model support: thinking content blocks end-to-end (fixes [#161](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/161)) + `reasoning_effort='xhigh'` for GPT-5.5 / o1 / o3 / o4 / DeepSeek-thinking. DeepSeek V4 Pro + Xiaomi MiMo + Qwen 3.6 + Doubao in `/setup` (options 7-10). Object-style hooks parser. Default model bumped to Claude Opus 4.7 + GPT-5.5. REPL input hardening (multi-line wrap / Cmd+V paste / CJK boundary). GitHub Actions CI.

> 🌙 **Let Claude Code do research while you sleep.** Wake up to find your paper scored, weaknesses identified, experiments run, and narrative rewritten — autonomously.
>
> 🪶 **Radically lightweight — no infrastructure, zero lock-in.** The entire skill layer is plain Markdown files. No framework to learn, no database to maintain, no Docker to configure, no daemon to babysit. Every skill is a single `SKILL.md` readable by any LLM — swap Claude Code for [Codex CLI](skills/skills-codex/), [OpenClaw](docs/OPENCLAW_ADAPTATION.md), [Cursor](docs/CURSOR_ADAPTATION.md), [Trae](docs/TRAE_ARIS_RUNBOOK_EN.md), [Antigravity](docs/ANTIGRAVITY_ADAPTATION.md), [Copilot CLI](docs/COPILOT_CLI_ADAPTATION.md), Windsurf, or your own agent and the workflows still work. Fork it, rewrite it, adapt it to your stack.

Custom [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skills for autonomous ML research workflows. These skills orchestrate **cross-model collaboration** — Claude Code drives the research while an external LLM (via [Codex MCP](https://github.com/openai/codex)) acts as a critical reviewer. 🔀 **Also supports [alternative model combinations](#alternative-model-combinations) (Kimi, LongCat, DeepSeek, etc.) — no Claude or OpenAI API required.** For example, [MiniMax-M3 + GLM-5 or GLM-5 + MiniMax-M3](docs/MiniMax-GLM-Configuration.md). 🤖 **[Codex CLI native](skills/skills-codex/)** — full skill set also available for OpenAI Codex. 🖱️ **[Cursor](docs/CURSOR_ADAPTATION.md)** — works in Cursor too. 🖥️ **[Trae](docs/TRAE_ARIS_RUNBOOK_EN.md)** — ByteDance AI IDE. 🚀 **[Antigravity](docs/ANTIGRAVITY_ADAPTATION.md)** — Google's agent-first IDE. 🐙 **[Copilot CLI](docs/COPILOT_CLI_ADAPTATION.md)** — GitHub's terminal agent (native SKILL.md + MCP). 🆓 **[Free tier via ModelScope](docs/MODELSCOPE_GUIDE.md) — zero cost, zero lock-in.**

> 💭 **Why not self-play with a single model?** Using Claude Code subagents or agent teams for both execution and review is technically possible, but tends to fall into **local minima** — the same model reviewing its own patterns creates blind spots.
>
> *Think of it like adversarial vs. stochastic bandits: a single model self-reviewing is the stochastic case (predictable reward noise), while cross-model review is adversarial (the reviewer actively probes weaknesses the executor didn't anticipate) — and adversarial bandits are fundamentally harder to game.*
>
> 💭 **Why two models, not more?** Two is the minimum needed to break self-play blind spots, and 2-player games converge to Nash equilibrium far more efficiently than n-player ones. Adding more reviewers increases API cost and coordination overhead with diminishing returns — the biggest gain is going from 1→2, not 2→4.
>
> Claude Code's strength is fast, fluid execution; Codex (GPT-5.5 xhigh) is slower but more deliberate and rigorous in critique. These complementary styles — **speed × rigor** — produce better outcomes than either model talking to itself.
>
> 🧿 **Want the strongest possible reviewer?** Add `— reviewer: oracle-pro` to any skill to route reviews through **GPT-5.5 Pro** via [Oracle MCP](https://github.com/steipete/oracle). Pro-level reasoning for proof verification, experiment auditing, and final stress tests. Works with API key or free browser mode. [Setup →](#-optional-gpt-54-pro-via-oracle)

## 1. 🎯 More Than Just a Prompt

> These are full pipelines — you can also use each workflow independently. Already have an idea? Skip to Workflow 1.5. Have results? Jump to Workflow 3. Got reviews? Jump to Workflow 4. Want persistent memory? Enable [Research Wiki](#-research-wiki--persistent-research-memory). See [Quick Start](#quick-start) for all commands and [Workflows](#workflows) for the full breakdown.

**Basic mode** — give ARIS a research direction, it handles everything:

```
/research-pipeline "factorized gap in discrete diffusion LMs"
```

**🔥 Targeted mode** — got a paper you want to improve? Give ARIS the paper + the code:

```
/research-pipeline "improve method X" — ref paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04329, base repo: https://github.com/org/project
```

ARIS reads the paper → finds its weaknesses → clones the codebase → generates ideas that specifically fix *those* weaknesses with *that* code → runs experiments → writes your paper. Like telling a research assistant: *"read this paper, use this repo, find what's missing, and fix it."*

> Mix and match: `ref paper` only = "what can be improved?", `base repo` only = "what can I build with this code?", both = "improve *this* paper using *this* code."

**🔥 Rebuttal mode** — reviews just dropped? Don't panic. ARIS reads every concern, builds a strategy, and drafts a rebuttal that's grounded, structured, and under the character limit:

```
/rebuttal "paper/ + reviews" — venue: ICML, character limit: 5000
```

Three safety gates — rebuttal will NOT finalize if any fails:
- 🔒 **No fabrication** — every claim maps to paper/review/user-confirmed result
- 🔒 **No overpromise** — every promise is user-approved
- 🔒 **Full coverage** — every reviewer concern is tracked

Two outputs: `PASTE_READY.txt` (exact char count, paste to venue) + `REBUTTAL_DRAFT_rich.md` (extended version for manual editing).

<details>
<summary><b>Show rebuttal parameters</b> — venue, character limit (required), quick mode, auto experiment, stress test rounds, followup rounds</summary>

**After acceptance** — your paper is in, now prepare the presentation:

```
/paper-slides "paper/"     # → Beamer PDF + PPTX + speaker notes + Q&A prep
/paper-poster-html "paper/" # → measurement-gated HTML/CSS poster → print-ready PDF
```

## 2. 📢 What's New

- **2026-06-20** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 📚 **Research wiki: all four node layers now have deterministic writers — fixes "re-generated ideas not recorded"** ([#305](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/305), [#306](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/306), [#307](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/307), [#308](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/308)). A user hit a real bug — ideas recorded on the first `/idea-creator` run vanished on re-generation — because wiki pages were written **freehand**, a prose step the model skips on a re-prompt. Each layer now has a dedicated `research_wiki.py` writer joining `ingest_paper`: **`add_claim`** (claims born at [`/proof-checker`](skills/proof-checker/SKILL.md)), **`upsert_idea`** ([`/idea-creator`](skills/idea-creator/SKILL.md)), **`add_experiment`** ([`/result-to-claim`](skills/result-to-claim/SKILL.md)) — each guarded by a drift-check so it can't silently regress to dead code. A claim's `status` is now a strict **proof axis** (`verified`/`refuted`/`unproven`/…) while experiment support is carried by `supports`/`invalidates` **edges** (closing a latent contradiction the shared validator rejected), and the **Codex-CLI skill mirror is synced** to match. **Zero behavior change** when no `research-wiki/` is present.
- **2026-06-19** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🛰 **Overnight-loop resilience: silent-death watchdog + stall→structural-pivot** ([#300](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/300), [#301](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/301), [#302](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/302); operational patterns absorbed from [Deli Chen's AutoResearch](https://victorchen96.github.io/auto_research/framework.html) framework). Two failure modes an unattended `/loop` / `CronCreate` heartbeat couldn't catch. **(1) Silent death** — the heartbeat is parasitic on a living session, so context compaction or a closed session kills it and nothing notices. A new watchdog `loop` task type ([`watchdog.py`](tools/watchdog.py)) judges liveness by the state file's mtime against the loop's own `stale_after_seconds`, surfacing **STALE / MISSING / COMPLETED** to `alerts.log` — **detect-only**, it never restarts a verdict-bearing loop. **(2) Cognitive spin** — a stalled loop retries near-variants forever. A new [`iteration_log.py`](tools/iteration_log.py) counts NEW findings per tick: `stale_count ≥ 2` forces a **structural** pivot (change the frame + pick an untried direction), `≥ 4` escalates to a human. Both are **Type-A signals** — "keep going / change direction," never "good enough"; quality still terminates in the cross-model jury.
- **2026-06-07** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🖼️ **[`/paper-poster-html`](skills/paper-poster-html/SKILL.md) — new DEFAULT poster pipeline (skill #79); LaTeX `/paper-poster` retired to a redirect stub.** Builds the poster as a single HTML/CSS file on the venue's exact print canvas and iterates by *measuring, not eyeballing*: hard gates (column-balance spread < 5 px, two-hue design-token discipline, real-paper-figure provenance manifest, figure-area bands) must PASS before any reviewer sees the poster; a closed fix vocabulary (token / component / rebalance / asset / canvas) structurally kills the cosmetic patch-loop; a fresh cross-model review acquits content fidelity (claim→evidence audit + final print-readiness pass). Ships 3 templates + a catalogued component library (incl. density components: equation anatomy, flow-strip, duo figures, derived-Δ tables, claim pills) and 6 venue token packs. Core gate machinery adapted from [posterly](https://github.com/Chenruishuo/posterly) (MIT, by [@Chenruishuo](https://github.com/Chenruishuo)) — ARIS adds the style/asset gates, the density system, and the cross-model loop. ⚠️ `/paper-poster` now redirects to `/paper-poster-html`; the legacy LaTeX pipeline remains only in git history.
- **2026-05-31** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🤝 **Community spotlight — two tools worth a look.** [**Claude Fleet**](https://github.com/tianyilt/claude-fleet) ([@tianyilt](https://github.com/tianyilt)) — a local read-only dashboard to triage / Focus / full-text-search across many concurrent **Claude Code + Codex** windows. [**posterly**](https://github.com/Chenruishuo/posterly) ([@Chenruishuo](https://github.com/Chenruishuo)) — a Claude Code skill that builds academic conference posters as a single HTML/CSS file → print-ready PDF via headless Chromium (no LaTeX).

- **2026-05-31** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🛰 **Fourth reviewer backend: Gemini via Antigravity CLI** ([#267](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/267) by [@ZGJY95](https://github.com/ZGJY95)). `— reviewer: agy` routes review through the Antigravity CLI for users without Codex MCP / Oracle — **fail-closed on the cross-model invariant** (recovers + verifies the real Gemini-family model, refuses non-Gemini, binds the recovered transcript to the call via a user-event nonce). Wired into [`reviewer-routing.md`](skills/shared-references/reviewer-routing.md).

- **2026-05-29** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) ⚙️ **ultracode-native convention layer — fan out for breadth on any runtime tier, keep the cross-model jury sacred**. Three new [`shared-references`](skills/shared-references/) docs decouple *breadth* from *verdict*: [`fan-out-pattern.md`](skills/shared-references/fan-out-pattern.md) (skills generate candidates across same-family Claude subagents — Tier-1 Workflow / Tier-2 Agent / Tier-3 sequential — all ending in the *identical* cross-model jury), [`acceptance-gate.md`](skills/shared-references/acceptance-gate.md) ("a loop can DRIVE, it cannot ACQUIT" — self-judge execution-completeness, never quality/correctness), and [`external-cadence.md`](skills/shared-references/external-cadence.md) (`/loop` & `CronCreate` are fire-control, never a jury). Wired into `/idea-creator`, `/research-lit`, `/proof-checker`, `/kill-argument` (fan-out) plus 16 skills (cadence fence/affordance). Also stripped 48 vestigial `Agent` grants (least-privilege + a drift-check guard), fixed `/idea-creator`'s same-family idea pre-filter, and reconciled an `/auto-review-loop` `OR`→`AND` stop-condition inconsistency. **Non-ultracode users benefit immediately** — fan-out degrades to sequential with the same final jury.

- **2026-05-28** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 📝 **First blog shipped**: [A Survey on Continuous DLM (2026 H1, 6 papers)](https://wanshuiyin.github.io/ARIS-in-AI-Offer/blogs/continuous_dlm_representation_perspective.html) — long-form bilingual technical survey by Ruofeng Yang (SJTU), written end-to-end through the ARIS-in-AI-Offer workflow (Claude Opus 4.7 + Codex GPT-5.5 xhigh + Gemini auto-gemini-3 cross-model discussion). Compares ELF, ByteDance Cola-DLM, and Flow-Matching family across discrete-DLM problems, the "known-unknown" continuous space idea, training pipeline, architecture / params / shapes, inference grids + Tab 6/7 numerical results, denoising trajectories, and a Field Landscape against Cola-DLM. A 1.7 MB self-contained HTML (no build) — demonstrates the kind of long-form analysis the `/render-html` toolchain can produce.

- **2026-05-26** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🌐 **HTML auto-emission activated at 8 workflow checkpoints**. `/idea-discovery`, `/auto-review-loop`, `/research-pipeline`, `/kill-argument`, `/proof-checker`, `/paper-claim-audit`, `/citation-audit`, `/rebuttal` now auto-render their primary MD artifact to a single-file HTML view via [`/render-html`](skills/render-html/SKILL.md). Cost-tiered: interim views use `--no-review`, audit-class / reviewer-facing deliverables keep the full Codex render-fidelity gate. Default on (`RENDER_HTML = true`); per-skill opt-out. Failures non-blocking — source MD stays canonical.
- **2026-05-26** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🤝 **Community PR wave — 5 merges this week**. [`/wiki-enrich`](skills/wiki-enrich/SKILL.md) ([#247](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/247) by [@hungchun0201](https://github.com/hungchun0201)) fills paper TODOs `ingest_paper` leaves as scaffolds — Karpathy LLM-wiki principle, fetch chain alphaxiv→deepxiv→arXiv. [Mirror drift checker + CI](tools/check_skills_inventory.py) ([#241](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/241) by [@VeraPyuyi](https://github.com/VeraPyuyi)) keeps main↔mirror in sync. `/research-pipeline` Stage 2/3 unified into `/experiment-bridge` delegation ([#243](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/243) by [@ZBigFish](https://github.com/ZBigFish)) — old inline was a strict subset of the bridge. Windows PowerShell installer parity with reparse-chain inside-repo guard + `-FromOld` legacy migration + Windows CI matrix ([#242](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/242) by [@VeraPyuyi](https://github.com/VeraPyuyi)). Plus [`manual-review` MCP](mcp-servers/manual-review/README.md) ([#246](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/246) by [@ZBigFish](https://github.com/ZBigFish)) — **third reviewer backend `— reviewer: manual`** for zero-cost cross-model review (paste prompt to any non-Claude model: DeepSeek / Kimi / ChatGPT / Gemini / local llama); cross-model invariant guarded by bilingual UI banner + per-session token auth + fail-closed when MCP unavailable.

- **2026-05-17** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🐙 **[GitHub Copilot CLI adaptation](docs/COPILOT_CLI_ADAPTATION.md)** — native `SKILL.md` + MCP support, no skill mirror needed. Installer (`install_aris_copilot.sh`) + smart-updater + 13-test suite. Community contribution by [@EarendelH](https://github.com/EarendelH) ([#229](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/229), closes [#214](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/214) / [#227](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/227) / [#203](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/203)).
- **2026-05-17** — ![FIX](https://img.shields.io/badge/FIX-orange?style=flat-square) 🛠 **Tools-stability roadmap (Phase 1+2+3) complete** (closes [#176](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/176) / [#177](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/177) / [#178](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/178)). Community reported that helper scripts weren't propagating into user projects after `install_aris.sh`. **Phase 1** — every SKILL.md caller of the 10 canonical helpers now resolves via the strict-safe 3-layer chain `.aris/tools/` → `tools/` → `$ARIS_REPO/tools/` documented in [`integration-contract.md`](skills/shared-references/integration-contract.md) §2 (which also defines 5 failure policies A/B/C/D1/D2/E). **Phase 2** — new [advisory CI lint](.github/workflows/lint-skills-helpers.yml) catches hardcoded `python3 tools/foo.py` patterns in PR-modified SKILL.md (advisory only, never fails CI). **Phase 3** — three single-owner helpers (`figure-spec`, `paper-illustration-image2`, `experiment-queue`) moved into their SKILL's `scripts/` subdirectory; owner SKILLs use Layer 0 `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/` ahead of the canonical chain; legacy `tools/` paths retained as `os.execv` Python forwarding shims. **⚠️ Existing users**: no action needed — legacy `tools/` entries are now shims. If you haven't run `install_aris.sh` since 2026-04-30, one idempotent rerun catches everything up.
- **2026-05-14** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🩹 **`/paper-plan` + `/paper-write` learn `GAP_REPORT.md` + `<!-- DATA_NEEDED -->` discipline** ([#217](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/217)). When `— style-ref:` is set and the user's project has structural assets (`figures/`, `results/`, `NARRATIVE_REPORT.md`, etc.), `/paper-plan` emits a **Gap Report** mapping the exemplar's section topology + density (from `style_profile.md`) against your actual assets — surfacing slots you have **no evidence to fill** (e.g., "exemplar has 3×4 ablation table, you have no ablation data"). Then `/paper-write` writes `<!-- DATA_NEEDED: <Slot ID> — <description> -->` HTML comments **instead of fabricating content** at missing slots — invisible in the compiled PDF, `grep`-friendly for human triage / `/experiment-bridge` follow-up. Narrow carve-out from the "no placeholders" rule, scoped to GAP_REPORT-listed slots only. Original idea by [@zhangpelf](https://github.com/zhangpelf).

- **2026-05-14** — ![BREAKING](https://img.shields.io/badge/BREAKING-purple?style=flat-square) ⚙️ **Default reviewer model: `gpt-5.4` → `gpt-5.5`** across ~30 SKILL.md `REVIEWER_MODEL` defaults. Codex MCP has routed `gpt-5.5` as the default since 2026-04-24; this catches the docs up to runtime. **⚠️ Behavior changes**: (a) `.aris/traces/*` JSONs from prior runs are **not reproducible** — re-runs on 5.5 may emit different `WARN/FAIL` verdicts on borderline cases (reviewer-quality lift, not regression). (b) ChatGPT Plus/Pro monthly quotas drain faster under heavy use. **Fallback**: pass `— reviewer-model: gpt-5.4` per invocation, or pin `REVIEWER_MODEL = gpt-5.4` per skill. Oracle Pro tier (routed via `— reviewer: oracle-pro`) is a separate path and unaffected.
- **2026-05-13** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🔍 **[`tools/verify_papers.py`](tools/verify_papers.py) + Pre-Search Verification Protocol — anti-hallucination filter for literature-facing skills**. New helper does 3-layer fallback verification (arXiv batch API up to 40 IDs/request → CrossRef DOI lookup → Semantic Scholar fuzzy title match, default 0.6 word-overlap) and emits 4-state per-paper status (`verified` / `unverified` / `verify_pending` / `error`) plus a top-level verdict aligning with `assurance-contract.md` (`PASS` / `WARN` / `BLOCKED` / `ERROR`). Transient failures (5xx, timeouts, 429) are tagged `verify_pending` and **excluded from the hallucination rate** so network blips don't get conflated with fabricated references. Per-project cache at `<project>/.aris/cache/verify_papers.json` with 30-day TTL; canonical key priority `arxiv:{id_without_version}` → `doi:{lowercase}` → `title:{sha1[:16]}`. New `Pre-Search Verification Protocol` subsection in [`shared-references/citation-discipline.md`](skills/shared-references/citation-discipline.md) makes the split explicit: this protocol is the **fast filter** between SEARCH (Step 1) and full VERIFY (Step 2); `/citation-audit` and `/paper-claim-audit` remain the submission-time audit gates and are not replaced. [`/research-lit`](skills/research-lit/SKILL.md) gets a mandatory `Step 1.5: Verify Candidate Papers` calling the helper; [`/idea-creator`](skills/idea-creator/SKILL.md) and [`/novelty-check`](skills/novelty-check/SKILL.md) add a Key Rule reference for cited Closest Prior Work / landscape entries. Unverified papers are **retained** in output tagged `[UNVERIFIED]` (retention-over-silent-removal) so search-quality issues stay visible. Set `ARIS_VERIFY_EMAIL` in your shell to lift CrossRef to the polite-pool rate. Original signal from [@YiwenZhu77](https://github.com/YiwenZhu77) in [#120](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/120) — landed via clean reimplementation rather than direct merge (PR was 5 weeks old + scope creep into figure-style).
- **2026-05-06** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🎤 **[`/paper-talk`](skills/paper-talk/SKILL.md) workflow + [`/slides-polish`](skills/slides-polish/SKILL.md) skill — end-to-end conference talk pipeline**. `/paper-talk` orchestrates paper → slide outline → Beamer + PPTX → per-page polish → assurance audits → final report (sister to `/paper-writing`, `/paper-poster`); composes `/paper-slides`, `/slides-polish`, plus `/paper-claim-audit` + `/citation-audit` when `assurance: conference-ready`. `/slides-polish` is the post-generation visual pass: per-page Codex review against a reference PDF + a fix-pattern catalog (PPTX font scaling 1.5-1.8× for projector-readable size, text-frame resize after font bump, banner-as-tcolorbox, italic style leak guard, em-dash spacing, Chinese EA font hint via PingFang SC, anonymity placeholder discipline). Assurance ladder `draft / polished (default) / conference-ready` is independent from the effort axis; `effort: lite, assurance: conference-ready` is legal and means "fast pipeline, every audit must emit verdict before final". Phase 4 staging adapter materializes slide text + speaker notes + talk script as a synthetic paper directory (`.aris/paper-talk/audit-input/sections/*.tex` + symlinked `.bib` / `results/` / `figures/`) so the existing audits run with their paper-shaped contracts and emit 6-state JSON verdicts per `shared-references/assurance-contract.md`.
- **2026-05-05** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🔁 **`/resubmit-pipeline` — Workflow 5: text-only resubmit across venues** ([#208](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/208)). Port a polished paper from one venue to another under hard constraints (no new experiments, no bib edits, no framework changes, never overwrite prior submissions). 5 phases: physical isolation → 5-layer anonymity check → audits (proof / claim / citation `--soft-only`) → microedits via `/auto-paper-improvement-loop --edit-whitelist` with per-round diff gate → adversarial gate via `/kill-argument` → final compile + Overleaf push via `/overleaf-sync`. Two prerequisite SKILL upgrades shipped in the same PR: **`/auto-paper-improvement-loop --edit-whitelist <path>`** (YAML schema with allowed/forbidden paths + `forbidden_operations` like `new_cite` / `new_theorem_env` / `numerical_claim`, `forbidden_deletions`, `requires_user_approval_for`, `max_edits_per_round`) and **`/citation-audit --soft-only`** (translates KEEP/FIX/REPLACE/REMOVE verdicts to text-rewrite proposals when bib is frozen; hallucinated citations get `drop_cite_in_body_only` action). Master `RESUBMIT_REPORT.json` ledger per `shared-references/assurance-contract.md`; 7-verdict failure mode table including `USER_DECISION` runtime state.
- **2026-05-05** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🗡 **`/kill-argument` — adversarial Attack-Adjudication review for theory papers** ([#206](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/206)). Two fresh codex 5.5 + xhigh threads: Thread 1 writes the strongest 200-word rejection memo a senior area chair would produce; Thread 2 (independent adjudicator, NOT defender) reads the current paper and classifies each rejection point as `answered_by_current_text` / `partially_answered` / `still_unresolved` with file:line evidence. Output: `KILL_ARGUMENT.{md,json}`, detect-only. Integrated as **Phase 5.6** of `/paper-writing` (between claim-audit and citation-audit) and as the canonical implementation called from `/auto-paper-improvement-loop` Step 5.5 — replaces inline prompt in both places. Mandatory at `assurance: submission` for theory-heavy / scope-heavy papers; emits `NOT_APPLICABLE` for empirical papers without scope claims. Audit JSON is `verify_paper_audits.sh`-compatible (full schema per `shared-references/assurance-contract.md`, 6-state verdict). Catches the failure mode score-based reviews miss: when every local component is correct (numbers match, cites resolve, theorems prove) but the paper still oversells what it actually establishes.
- **2026-05-04** — ![FIX](https://img.shields.io/badge/FIX-orange?style=flat-square) 🪲 **`/research-wiki` and 8 caller skills now resolve helper via fallback chain** ([#204](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/204)). Bug: after `bash tools/install_aris.sh` the helper lives at `.aris/tools/research_wiki.py` (symlink), but skills hard-coded `tools/research_wiki.py` and silently failed when invoked — `research-wiki/` stayed empty across full W1 runs. Fix: 3-layer chain (`.aris/tools/` → `tools/` → `$ARIS_REPO/tools/`) codified in [`shared-references/wiki-helper-resolution.md`](skills/shared-references/wiki-helper-resolution.md). The manual-copy workaround at `<project>/tools/research_wiki.py` is layer 2, so users who `cp`-installed the helper as a temporary fix continue to work. **⚠️ Existing users**: rerun `bash tools/install_aris.sh` once — also picks up a separate Python 3.9 `ImportError` fix in the helper.
- **2026-05-03** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🎨 **Opt-in `— style-ref: <source>` for writer-side skills** ([#202](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/202)). `/paper-{plan,write,writing,illustration,poster,slides}`, `/grant-proposal`, and `/auto-paper-improvement-loop` accept an optional `— style-ref: <source>` argument that mimics a reference paper's *structural* style (section ordering, theorem/figure density, sentence cadence, citation style) **without copying its prose, claims, or terminology**. Sources: local `.tex` dir/file, local PDF, arXiv id (`2501.12345` or `arxiv:2501.12345`), HTTP/HTTPS URL. Overleaf URLs/IDs are rejected — clone via `/overleaf-sync setup <id>` first. **Default OFF**; existing behavior unchanged when the flag is absent. Reviewer / auditor sub-skills (`/proof-checker`, `/paper-claim-audit`, `/citation-audit`, the improvement-loop reviewer) never see the style ref — cross-model review independence preserved. **⚠️ Existing ARIS users**: the helper ships at `tools/extract_paper_style.py`, distributed via the `.aris/tools` symlink (`install_aris.sh` Phase 0, added in [#192](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/192)). **Re-run `bash tools/install_aris.sh` once** to refresh the symlink and pick up the helper. Manual fallback: `cp <ARIS-repo>/tools/extract_paper_style.py <your-project>/tools/`. Without either, the writer skill aborts with a clear error pointing here.
- **2026-05-02** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🪨 **Community spotlight: [rosetta](https://github.com/SyntaxSmith/rosetta)** by [@SyntaxSmith](https://github.com/SyntaxSmith). Programmatic access to **ChatGPT Pro / `gpt-5.5-pro` / DeepResearch** from Node, via Chrome CDP Fetch interception + WebSocket second-leg streaming; ships an MCP server for Claude Code / Codex / Cline. Alternative implementation path to Oracle MCP for ARIS users invoking `— reviewer: oracle-pro` — same target capability (Pro-tier reviewer), different mechanics. Indexed under [Awesome Community Skills & Extensions](#awesome-community-skills). 🌟 if you're using it!
- **2026-05-02** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 💎🧿 **Model & MCP routing updates**. (a) [`/gemini-search`](skills/gemini-search/SKILL.md) default bumped to `gemini-3-pro-preview` (strongest Gemini, out-of-box). ⚠️ **Action required**: requires `gemini-cli` v0.40+ (run `gemini --version`; upgrade with `npm i -g @google/gemini-cli` if older). Legacy override: `/gemini-search "topic" — model: gemini-2.5-pro`. Other overrides: `gemini-3-flash-preview` (faster), `auto-gemini-3` (load-routed). (b) [`/idea-discovery`](skills/idea-discovery/SKILL.md) Phase 1 now includes Gemini in its literature survey by default ([#199](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/199)) — auto-injects `— sources: all, gemini` into `/research-lit` unless the user passed an explicit `— sources:`; graceful skip if `gemini-cli` not installed. (c) Oracle MCP upstream PR queue ([`steipete/oracle/pulls`](https://github.com/steipete/oracle/pulls)) is the first triage stop when invoking `— reviewer: oracle-pro` (especially `o3-deep-research` / `gpt-5.5-pro`) — ARIS does not vendor Oracle MCP; check upstream first if behavior surprises you ([reviewer-routing.md](skills/shared-references/reviewer-routing.md))
- **2026-05-02** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🛠️🔗 **Tools-infrastructure migration started**. (a) [`install_aris.sh`](tools/install_aris.sh) creates optional `.aris/tools` symlink ([#192](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/192), closes [#174](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/174)) — Phase 0 of the 4-step tools-stability plan (#174 → #176 → #177 → #178); idempotent, **zero impact until rerun**. (b) [`/experiment-queue`](skills/experiment-queue/SKILL.md) orchestration paths repaired ([#193](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/193)) — first real user of the symlink; 7 cascading bugs fixed via 3 rounds of Codex MCP `gpt-5.5` xhigh audit. Pure prose + docstring; `queue_manager.py` logic untouched. Windows `install_aris.ps1` parallel update tracked as follow-up
- **2026-05-02** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🔬 **Three new opt-in audit flags via fast-path delegated-agent workflow** ([#187](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/187), [#188](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/188), [#189](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/189)). [`/citation-audit --uncited`](skills/citation-audit/SKILL.md) surfaces bib entries with no `\cite{}` reference (detect-only). [`/proof-checker --deep-fix`](skills/proof-checker/SKILL.md) adds a repair-grade plan to the Phase 1 reviewer prompt (corrected statement / patch plan / closure tests + Schur/quadratic-form algebra sanity). [`/proof-checker --restatement-check`](skills/proof-checker/SKILL.md) adds Phase 3.6 cross-location theorem drift detection (6 drift signatures). **Zero behavior change** when flags unset. Plus doc PRs [#190](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/190) (thread-policy) + [#191](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/191) (auto-loop xref). Delegated-agent + maintainer-fixup pattern; Codex MCP `gpt-5.5` xhigh review caught 6+ blockers
- **2026-05-01** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🔍 **Gemini + OpenAlex literature sources for `/research-lit`** ([#175](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/175), community contribution by [@stdAri](https://github.com/stdAri)). Two opt-in sources: [`/gemini-search`](skills/gemini-search/SKILL.md) (AI-driven discovery via [`jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool`](https://github.com/jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool) MCP) and [`/openalex`](skills/openalex/SKILL.md) (250M+ work open citation graph, no API key). Triggered via `— sources: gemini` or `— sources: openalex`; **zero behavior change** when default `all` (both excluded). Maintainer fixups: corrected `@google/gemini-cli` npm name; added `try/except ImportError` + bash preflight for graceful OpenAlex skip when `requests` missing
- **2026-04-30** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 📝 **`/rebuttal` per-reviewer thread mode + transferable patterns** ([SKILL.md](skills/rebuttal/SKILL.md)). Adds `VENUE_MODE` (`single_document` | `per_reviewer_thread`) for OpenReview-style venues, `reviewer_priority: pivotal` routing, `structural_distinction` response mode, 5 reviewer-defensive heuristics, 2 Phase 5 lints, and severity-scaled stress rounds. Default `VENUE_MODE = single_document` keeps ICML-style behavior — **zero change for existing users**. Three rounds of cross-model review before/after merge
- **2026-04-30** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🪞 **Codex skill mirror rebuilt + dedicated install/update chain** ([#179](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/179), community contribution by [@No-518](https://github.com/No-518)). `skills/skills-codex/` now mirrors all 67 mainline skills; replaces `mcp__codex__codex` reviewer path with Codex-native `spawn_agent` + `send_input`. New [`tools/install_aris_codex.sh`](tools/install_aris_codex.sh) + [`tools/smart_update_codex.sh`](tools/smart_update_codex.sh) handle project-local symlinks with manifest tracking. Anti-drift: `tests/test_codex_skill_mirror.py` + `tests/test_codex_install_update.py` (26 failure paths).

- **2026-04-24** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🎨 **[`/paper-illustration-image2`](skills/paper-illustration-image2/SKILL.md)** — Codex-native image generation as Phase 2b illustration backend ([#166](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/166), community contribution by [@kbr19-thu](https://github.com/kbr19-thu) 清华). Uses ChatGPT Plus/Pro quota via local [Codex app-server MCP bridge](mcp-servers/codex-image2/) — **no `GEMINI_API_KEY` required**. Triggered by `/paper-writing — illustration: codex-image2`; default stays `figurespec` (**zero behavior change**). Async-only API, sandboxed writes to `figures/ai_generated/`, [integration-contract](skills/shared-references/integration-contract.md)-compliant helper. Marked **experimental** (Codex debug app-server is unstable upstream)
- **2026-04-21** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 📚 **Research Wiki ingest actually works now** ([`research_wiki.py`](tools/research_wiki.py), [`/research-wiki`](skills/research-wiki/SKILL.md)). Fixes user-reported bug where `/research-wiki init` left `papers/` empty forever (`ingest` subcommand had no implementation; paper-reading skills had no wiki hook). New canonical `python3 tools/research_wiki.py ingest_paper` helper owns slugging / metadata fetch / dedup / page render; all 6 paper-reading skills wired to it. Manual backfill via `sync --arxiv-ids` or `sync --from-file`. Ships with [`integration-contract.md`](skills/shared-references/integration-contract.md) formalizing the six-component pattern every cross-skill integration must follow
- **2026-04-21** — ![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-red?style=flat-square) 🛡️ **Assurance Gate: `— effort: beast | max` now really runs mandatory audits** ([`assurance-contract.md`](skills/shared-references/assurance-contract.md), [`tools/verify_paper_audits.sh`](tools/verify_paper_audits.sh)). Fixes silent-skip of `/proof-checker` / `/paper-claim-audit` / `/citation-audit` at high effort. New `assurance` axis (`draft` | `submission`) independent from `effort`: `lite` / `balanced` → `draft` (**zero behavior change**), `max` / `beast` → `submission`. At submission the 3 audits emit a JSON artifact with 6-state verdict; `paper-writing` Phase 6 runs the external verifier as source of truth (non-zero exit blocks Final Report). SHA256 input hashing catches stale audits. Escape hatch: `— effort: beast, assurance: draft`
- **2026-04-20** — 🩹 **Project install: flat layout + manifest tracking** — fixes a real bug where the previous nested install (`.claude/skills/aris/`) hid skills from Claude Code's slash-command discovery (CC only scans one directory level). Anyone who ran `install_aris.sh` before this date was silently affected. New `install_aris.sh` creates one symlink per skill at `.claude/skills/<name>`, writes a versioned manifest to `.aris/installed-skills.txt`, and is **re-runnable to reconcile** new/removed upstream skills. Defense-in-depth: 13 safety rules (no-symlinked-parents, exact-target revalidation, slug regex, atomic same-dir manifest rename, no-overwrite-real-files, mkdir-based portable lock, ADOPT for crash recovery, …). Granular `--adopt-existing` / `--replace-link` flags replace the all-or-nothing `--force`. Migration paths: `--from-old` for legacy nested symlink, `--migrate-copy keep-user|prefer-upstream` for legacy nested copy. `smart_update.sh --target-subdir .claude/skills/aris` is now deprecated with a redirect to `install_aris.sh`. Stale-file bug in `cp -r` overlay also fixed (now `rm -rf && cp -r` for safe-update path)
- **2026-04-19** — 🔗 **[`/overleaf-sync`](skills/overleaf-sync/SKILL.md)** — two-way bridge between local ARIS paper directory and an Overleaf project via the official **Overleaf Git bridge** (Premium). Lets collaborators keep editing in the Overleaf web UI while ARIS audit/edit pipelines (`/paper-claim-audit`, `/citation-audit`, `/auto-paper-improvement-loop`) keep running locally. Sub-commands: `setup` (one-time, user-driven so the agent never sees the token) / `pull` (with diff-protocol — flags half-sentences, typos, claim/cite changes that should re-trigger audits) / `push` (with confirmation gate before writing to shared Overleaf state) / `status` (3-way divergence check). **Token never touches the agent or any file** — primed once into macOS Keychain via the user's terminal, then auth-free for all subsequent agent operations
- **2026-04-19** — 📚 **[`/citation-audit`](skills/citation-audit/SKILL.md)** — fourth and final layer of the evidence-and-claim assurance stack (`experiment-audit` → `result-to-claim` → `paper-claim-audit` → `citation-audit`). Fresh cross-family reviewer (gpt-5.4 via Codex MCP) with web/DBLP/arXiv lookup verifies every `\cite{...}` along three independent axes: **existence** (paper resolves at claimed arXiv ID/DOI/venue), **metadata correctness** (authors/year/venue/title match canonical sources), and **context appropriateness** (the cited paper actually establishes the claim it supports — the most diagnostic check). Per-entry verdicts: KEEP / FIX / REPLACE / REMOVE. Auto-integrated into **Workflow 3 Phase 5.8** as the pre-submission bibliography gate. Empirical motivation: in a real submission run, several real papers were cited in contexts they did not actually support, and at least one entry shipped with `author = "Anonymous"` — none caught by metadata-only checks

- **2026-04-17** — 🔀 **`/experiment-queue` integrated into Workflow 1.5 + research-pipeline** — `experiment-bridge` Phase 4 Deploy now auto-routes by milestone job count: ≤5 jobs → `/run-experiment`, ≥10 jobs or phase dependencies → `/experiment-queue` (with OOM retry, stale-screen cleanup, wave-transition gating, crash-safe state). New `--- batch: queue` override for global force-queue mode. Large multi-seed sweeps from `EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md` (e.g., 36-cell `N × seed × n_train` grids) now get proper orchestration without manual queue invocation
- **2026-04-17** — 🔗 **[Project-local symlink install](tools/install_aris.sh)** (resolves [#118](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/118)) — new recommended default install. `bash tools/install_aris.sh` auto-detects platform (Claude Code / Codex CLI), creates `.claude/skills/aris` or `.agents/skills/aris` symlink to the ARIS repo, adds a managed `<!-- ARIS:BEGIN -->` block to `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` telling the agent to use only project-local skills, and records install metadata in `.aris/skill-source.txt`. **Solves the skill collision problem** when ARIS is mixed with Superpowers / OpenHands / other community packs in the same global skill directory. PowerShell version (`install_aris.ps1`) ships with junction support for Windows. **`smart_update.sh --target-subdir`** flag added for `.agents/skills/aris` (Codex) project-copy installs; symlinked installs now correctly refuse `smart_update` and direct users to `git pull`. Global install remains supported for power users
- **2026-04-16** — 🎨 **[`/figure-spec`](skills/figure-spec/SKILL.md)** — deterministic JSON→SVG renderer packaged as a first-class skill. Preferred default for architecture/workflow/pipeline/audit-cascade figures in papers. Shape-aware edge clipping (rect/circle/ellipse/diamond), self-loops, curved edges, multi-line labels with CJK width estimation. Editable vector output, reproducible (same spec → same SVG), no external API. **Phase 2b in Workflow 3 restored**: `illustration: figurespec` (new default) / `gemini` / `mermaid` / `false` — 4-way illustration selector with complementary strengths
- **2026-04-16** — ⚙️ **[`/experiment-queue`](skills/experiment-queue/SKILL.md)** — SSH job queue for multi-seed/multi-config ML experiments. Designed from real 36-cell NeurIPS sweep pain points: OOM-aware retry with backoff, stale-screen cleanup, wave-transition race prevention, teacher→student phase dependencies, crash-safe scheduler that resumes from JSON state. Declarative grid specs expand automatically (e.g., `N × seed × n_train → 36 jobs`). Configurable `conda_hook` + `gpu_free_threshold_mib` for non-standard environments. Use for ≥10 jobs; `/run-experiment` stays for ad-hoc
- **2026-04-15** — 🛡️ **Paper Writing Pipeline Hardening** — 10 empirically-motivated patches from a real NeurIPS run. `REVIEWER_BIAS_GUARD=true`: every review round uses a fresh thread (codex-reply inflated 3→8/10). Reviewer Independence Protocol: no fix summaries to reviewer. Step 4.5 Restatement Regression Test: catches theorem drift across fix rounds. Step 5.5 Kill Argument Exercise: final-round adversarial attack/defense for theory papers. Location-aware overfull blocking. Theory Paper Consistency Pass in `/paper-write`. Enforced Bib Hygiene with DBLP/CrossRef validation. Phase 5.5 Mandatory Final Claim Audit as submission gate. **Review Tracing Protocol**: full prompt/response pairs saved to `.aris/traces/` for reviewer-independence audit ([`review-tracing.md`](skills/shared-references/review-tracing.md), [`save_trace.sh`](tools/save_trace.sh)). Inspired by community contribution from @李傲龍
- **2026-04-15** — 🎨 **[FigureSpec Renderer v2](tools/figure_renderer.py)** — deterministic JSON→SVG figure generation for academic papers. Shape-aware edge clipping (rect/circle/ellipse/diamond), self-loops, curved edges, multi-line labels with CJK width estimation, comprehensive validation (type checks, structure, palette). Went through 5 rounds of Codex review (3/10→7/10). All architecture and workflow diagrams in the ARIS tech report were generated with this pipeline. New `--- mode: vector` for `/paper-illustration` skill
- **2026-04-14** — 📋 **[`/paper-claim-audit`](skills/paper-claim-audit/SKILL.md)** — zero-context paper-to-evidence verification. Fresh reviewer with NO prior context compares every number in the paper against raw result files. Catches rounding inflation, best-seed cherry-pick, config mismatch, delta errors, scope overclaim. Auto-integrated into Workflow 3 (Phase 4.7). Completes the 3-layer audit chain: `/experiment-audit` (code) → `/result-to-claim` (science) → `/paper-claim-audit` (reporting). 👁️ **Visual PDF review** also added to improvement loop — reviewer now sees compiled PDF, not just LaTeX source. Inspired by [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/tree/main/skills/research/research-paper-writing)
- **2026-04-13** — 🧿 **[GPT-5.4 Pro via Oracle](skills/shared-references/reviewer-routing.md)** — `— reviewer: oracle-pro` on any skill for the strongest available reviewer. API mode (fast) or browser mode (free). Supported on: `/research-review`, `/auto-review-loop`, `/experiment-audit`, `/proof-checker`, `/rebuttal`, `/idea-creator`, `/research-lit`. Default stays Codex xhigh. Not installed = zero impact. [Setup →](#-optional-gpt-54-pro-via-oracle)
- **2026-04-13** — 🔬 **[`/proof-checker`](skills/proof-checker/SKILL.md)** — rigorous mathematical proof verification via cross-model review. 20-category issue taxonomy, two-axis severity, side-condition checklists (DCT/MCT/Fubini/IFT/...), counterexample red team, proof-obligation ledger. Auto-integrated into Workflow 3: detects `\begin{theorem}` and runs before improvement loop. Complements `/proof-writer`
- **2026-04-10** — ⚡ **[Effort Levels](skills/shared-references/effort-contract.md)** — `— effort: lite | balanced | max | beast`. Controls work intensity across all skills: papers found, ideas generated, review rounds, writing depth. Codex reasoning stays `xhigh` always. `beast` = every knob to maximum for top-venue sprints. Default `balanced` = zero change for existing users. [Details →](#-effort-levels)
- **2026-04-10** — 🔎 **[DeepXiv integration](skills/deepxiv/SKILL.md)** — progressive paper retrieval via DeepXiv CLI. Opt-in: `— sources: deepxiv` or `— sources: all, deepxiv`. Staged reading: search → brief → head → section. `pip install deepxiv-sdk` to enable. Community contribution by [@DreamEnding](https://github.com/DreamEnding)
- **2026-04-10** — 🛡️ **[`/experiment-audit`](skills/experiment-audit/SKILL.md)** — cross-model experiment integrity verification. GPT-5.4 reads your eval scripts and results directly, checks for fake ground truth, self-normalized scores, phantom results, and scope inflation ([#131](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/131), [#57](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/issues/57)). Advisory — warns loudly, never blocks. `/result-to-claim` auto-reads audit if present. New [experiment-integrity.md](skills/shared-references/experiment-integrity.md) shared reference. **The executor must never judge its own integrity.**
- **2026-04-10** — 🧠 **[`tools/smart_update.sh`](tools/smart_update.sh)** — intelligent skill updater. Compares local vs upstream, detects personal customizations (server paths, API keys), only updates safe skills. `bash tools/smart_update.sh --apply`
- **2026-04-10** — 🏆 **Community paper: [UAV-CC](community_papers/UAV-CC.pdf)** — first community paper with full PDF archived. UAV change captioning benchmark for IEEE TGRS by [@wxx827](https://github.com/wxx827). Stack: Claude Opus 4.6 + Codex 5.4 xhigh + Cursor. Papers now archived in `community_papers/`
- **2026-04-08** — 📚 **[`/research-wiki`](skills/research-wiki/SKILL.md)** — persistent research knowledge base inspired by [Karpathy's LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f). Accumulates papers, ideas, experiments, and claims across the entire research lifecycle with typed relationships. Wiki-aware hooks in `/research-lit` (ingest papers), `/idea-creator` (read wiki + write ideas back), and `/result-to-claim` (update claim status + trigger re-ideation). Failed ideas become anti-repetition memory. **ARIS now learns from its mistakes.**
- **2026-04-05** — 🧬 **[`/meta-optimize`](skills/meta-optimize/SKILL.md)** — outer-loop harness optimization for ARIS. Passively logs skill invocations, tool calls, failures, and parameter overrides via [Claude Code hooks](templates/claude-hooks/meta_logging.json). Run `/meta-optimize` to analyze accumulated usage data and propose SKILL.md improvements — reviewer-gated, user-approved. Inspired by [Meta-Harness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.28052) (Lee et al., 2026). **ARIS now optimizes itself.**
- **2026-04-04** — 🔧 **Codex Plugin deep integration** — `/codex:rescue` now auto-invoked when experiments fail (Workflow 1.5) or LaTeX won't compile (Workflow 3). GPT independently diagnoses the bug before Claude retries — two AI debuggers are better than one. Optional: `codex exec` powers nightmare review, `/codex:rescue` powers auto-debug. [Setup →](#optional-codex-plugin-for-code-review)
- **2026-04-03** — ☁️ **[Modal serverless GPU](skills/serverless-modal/SKILL.md)** — no GPU? `gpu: modal` in CLAUDE.md, one command (`modal run launcher.py`), no SSH, no Docker, auto scale-to-zero. **$30/month free tier** — enough to try ARIS experiments without any hardware. `pip install modal && modal setup` and go. Community contribution by [@zeyuzhangzyz](https://github.com/zeyuzhangzyz)
- **2026-04-03** — 🎮 **Reviewer Difficulty Levels** — `medium` (default, unchanged), `hard` (reviewer memory + debate protocol), `nightmare` (GPT reads repo directly via `codex exec` — Claude can't hide anything). `— difficulty: nightmare` for maximum stress test before submission

- **2026-03-30** — 🔥 **Auto-debug & exhaust-before-surrender** — experiment-bridge auto-diagnoses failures (OOM, import, CUDA, NaN) and retries up to 3×. Inspired by [PUA](https://github.com/tanweai/pua)

## 3. 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install skills — project-local symlinks (recommended)
git clone https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep.git
bash Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/tools/install_aris.sh ~/your-project   # symlinks ARIS skills into <project>/.claude/skills/
# (prefer a global install instead? cp -r Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/)

# 1b. Update later (when upstream changes)
cd Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep && git pull
bash tools/smart_update.sh --apply   # updates safe skills, flags your personal customizations

# Optional Codex mirror managed project install
bash tools/install_aris_codex.sh ~/your-codex-project

# Managed Codex project update
cd Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep && git pull
bash tools/install_aris_codex.sh ~/your-codex-project --reconcile

# Copied Codex installs only (not for projects installed by install_aris_codex.sh)
bash tools/smart_update_codex.sh --local ~/.codex/skills
bash tools/smart_update_codex.sh --local ~/.codex/skills --apply

# 2. Set up Codex MCP (for review skills)
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex setup                    # set model to gpt-5.5 when prompted
claude mcp add codex -s user -- codex mcp-server

# 3. Use in Claude Code
claude
> /idea-discovery "your research direction"  # Workflow 1 — be specific! not "NLP" but "factorized gap in discrete diffusion LMs"
> /experiment-bridge                         # Workflow 1.5 — have a plan? implement + deploy + collect results
> /auto-review-loop "your paper topic or scope"  # Workflow 2: review → fix → re-review overnight
> /paper-writing "NARRATIVE_REPORT.md"       # Workflow 3: narrative → polished PDF
> /rebuttal "paper/ + reviews" — venue: ICML    # Workflow 4: parse reviews → draft rebuttal → follow-up
> /resubmit-pipeline "paper/" — venue: NeurIPS  # Workflow 5: port a polished paper to a new venue (text-only, no new experiments)
> /paper-talk "paper/" — venue: ICLR            # Workflow 6: paper → Beamer + PPTX talk + speaker notes + assurance audits
> /research-pipeline "your research direction"  # Full pipeline: Workflow 1 → 1.5 → 2 → 3 end-to-end
> /research-wiki init                           # 📚 Enable persistent research memory (one-time)

```

<details>
<summary><b>📚 Research Wiki (optional)</b> — one-line init for persistent memory across sessions; see <a href="#-research-wiki--persistent-research-memory">full Research Wiki section</a></summary>

Give ARIS persistent memory across sessions. Papers, ideas, failed experiments — nothing is forgotten:

```bash
# In Claude Code:
> /research-wiki init                         # creates research-wiki/ in your project
# That's it. From now on, /research-lit auto-ingests papers, /idea-creator reads
# the wiki before brainstorming (and writes ideas back), /result-to-claim updates
# claim status. Failed ideas become anti-repetition memory for future ideation.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🧬 Meta-Optimization (optional)</b> — passive usage logging + /meta-optimize for data-driven SKILL.md improvements; see <a href="#workflow-m-meta-optimize--aris-optimizes-itself">full Workflow M section</a></summary>

Run these in your **normal terminal** (not inside Claude Code) to enable passive usage logging:

```bash
# One-time setup in your project directory
mkdir -p .claude .aris/meta tools/meta_opt
cp Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/templates/claude-hooks/meta_logging.json .claude/settings.json
cp Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/tools/meta_opt/*.sh tools/meta_opt/
chmod +x tools/meta_opt/*.sh
# Then start Claude Code — hooks are active immediately
claude
```

Events are logged to **both** project-level (`.aris/meta/events.jsonl`) and global (`~/.aris/meta/events.jsonl`) logs. After 5+ workflow runs, run `/meta-optimize` to see data-driven improvement proposals. Use `/meta-optimize --global` to analyze trends across all your projects.

| `AUTO_PROCEED` | `true` | Auto-continue at idea selection gate. Set `false` to manually pick which idea to pursue before committing GPU time |
| `human checkpoint` | `false` | Pause after each review round so you can read the score, give custom modification instructions, skip specific fixes, or stop early |
| `sources` | `all` | Which literature sources to search: `zotero`, `obsidian`, `local`, `web`, `semantic-scholar`, `deepxiv`, `exa`, or `all`. Note: `semantic-scholar`, `deepxiv`, and `exa` must be explicitly listed — not included in `all` |
| `arxiv download` | `false` | Download top relevant arXiv PDFs during literature survey. When `false`, only fetches metadata (title, abstract, authors) |
| `DBLP_BIBTEX` | `true` | Fetch real BibTeX from [DBLP](https://dblp.org)/[CrossRef](https://www.crossref.org) instead of LLM-generated entries. Eliminates hallucinated citations. Zero install |
| `code review` | `true` | GPT-5.5 xhigh reviews experiment code before GPU deployment. Set `false` to skip |
| `wandb` | `false` | Auto-add W&B logging to experiment scripts. Set `true` + configure `wandb_project` in CLAUDE.md. `/monitor-experiment` pulls training curves from W&B |
| `illustration` | `gemini` | AI illustration in Workflow 3: `gemini` (default, needs `GEMINI_API_KEY`), `mermaid` (free), or `false` (skip) |
| `venue` | `ICLR` | Target venue: `ICLR`, `NeurIPS`, `ICML`, `CVPR`, `ACL`, `AAAI`, `ACM`. Determines LaTeX style file and page limit |
| `base repo` | `false` | GitHub repo URL to clone as base codebase (e.g., `— base repo: https://github.com/org/project`). No code? Build on top of an open-source project |
| `gpu` | `local` | GPU target: `local` (default), `remote` (SSH server), or `vast` (rent on-demand from [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai) — auto-provision, auto-destroy) |
| `compact` | `false` | Generate compact summary files (`IDEA_CANDIDATES.md`, `findings.md`, `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`) for short-context models and session recovery |
| `ref paper` | `false` | Reference paper to build on (PDF path or arXiv URL). Summarized first, then ideas extend/improve it. Combine with `base repo` for paper+code workflows |
| `effort` | `balanced` | Work intensity: `lite` (0.4x tokens), `balanced` (default), `max` (2.5x), `beast` (5-8x). Controls breadth/depth/iterations. Codex reasoning always `xhigh`. See [Effort Levels](#-effort-levels) |
| `reviewer` | `codex` | Reviewer backend: `codex` (GPT-5.5 xhigh, default), `oracle-pro` (GPT-5.5 Pro via [Oracle](https://github.com/steipete/oracle) — strongest reasoning). See [Setup →](#-optional-gpt-54-pro-via-oracle) |
| `difficulty` | `medium` | Reviewer adversarial level: `medium` (default), `hard` (+ memory + debate), `nightmare` (+ GPT reads repo via `codex exec`) |

<summary><b>Codex MCP config + alternative reviewer routing</b> — pin the model in <code>~/.codex/config.toml</code>; pointers to Codex+Claude-review, Codex+Gemini-review, and the Codex mirror install chain</summary>

**Important:** Codex MCP uses the model from `~/.codex/config.toml`, not from skill files. Make sure it says `model = "gpt-5.5"` (recommended). Other options: `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.2-codex`, `o3`. Run `codex setup` or edit the file directly.

**Want Codex to execute but Claude Code to review?** See [`docs/CODEX_CLAUDE_REVIEW_GUIDE.md`](docs/CODEX_CLAUDE_REVIEW_GUIDE.md). That path installs the base `skills/skills-codex/*`, then overlays `skills/skills-codex-claude-review/*`, and routes review-heavy skills through the local `claude-review` MCP bridge.

**Want Codex to execute but Gemini to review locally?** See [`docs/CODEX_GEMINI_REVIEW_GUIDE.md`](docs/CODEX_GEMINI_REVIEW_GUIDE.md) and [CN](docs/CODEX_GEMINI_REVIEW_GUIDE_CN.md). That path installs the base `skills/skills-codex/*`, then overlays `skills/skills-codex-gemini-review/*`, and routes the reviewer-aware predefined skills through the local `gemini-review` MCP bridge using direct Gemini API by default.

**Want the Codex mirror install chain?** Use `tools/install_aris_codex.sh` for managed project installs and `tools/smart_update_codex.sh` for copied Codex installs. The Claude scripts remain the mainline entry points for Claude projects.

</details>

See [full setup guide](#setup) for details and [alternative model combinations](#alternative-model-combinations) if you don't have Claude/OpenAI API.

## 4. ✨ Features

ARIS chains **79 composable skills** across the whole research lifecycle — literature & novelty → idea discovery → GPU experiments → autonomous review loop → paper writing → peer review — with **cross-model adversarial review** (Claude executes · GPT-5.5 xhigh reviews · optional **GPT-5.5 Pro** via Oracle), anti-hallucination DBLP/CrossRef citations, a persistent **Research Wiki**, flexible model backends, human-in-the-loop checkpoints, and optional Feishu / Zotero / Obsidian / GPU integrations.

🔥 *And it scales to any agent's **ultracode-style deep mode** — the breadth/firepower pass adapts to the runtime (Claude Code ultracode + workflows on Opus 4.8, Codex `spawn_agent`, or plain sequential), feeding three roles: **breadth · cross-model review → accuracy · research wiki → memory**. However a loop is driven, it reports to the same cross-model jury + research wiki — **it can drive, never acquit**.*

<details>
<summary><b>Full feature list</b></summary>

- 📊 **79 composable skills** — mix and match, or chain into full pipelines (`/idea-discovery`, `/auto-review-loop`, `/paper-writing`, `/research-pipeline`). See [full catalog →](docs/SKILLS_CATALOG.md)
- 🔍 **Literature & novelty** — multi-source paper search (**[Zotero](docs/integrations/ZOTERO.md)** + **[Obsidian](docs/integrations/OBSIDIAN.md)** + **local PDFs** + arXiv/Scholar) + cross-model novelty verification
- 💡 **Idea discovery** — literature survey → brainstorm 8-12 ideas → novelty check → GPU pilot experiments → ranked report
- 🔄 **Auto review loop** — 4-round autonomous review, 5/10 → 7.5/10 overnight with 20+ GPU experiments
- 📝 **Paper writing** — narrative → outline → figures → LaTeX → PDF → auto-review (4/10 → 8.5/10), one command. Anti-hallucination citations via [DBLP](https://dblp.org)/[CrossRef](https://www.crossref.org)
- 🤖 **Cross-model collaboration** — Claude Code executes, GPT-5.5 xhigh reviews. Adversarial, not self-play. Optional: `— reviewer: oracle-pro` → **GPT-5.5 Pro** via [Oracle](https://github.com/steipete/oracle)
- 📝 **Peer review** — review others' papers as a conference reviewer, with structured scoring and meta-review
- 🖥️ **Review-driven experiments** — when GPT-5.5 says "run an ablation", Claude auto-writes the script, rsyncs to GPU, runs in `screen`, collects results, folds back into the paper. Configure server in `CLAUDE.md` ([setup](#gpu-server-setup)), or rent from [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai) with `gpu: vast`
- 🔀 **Flexible models** — default Claude × GPT-5.5, also supports [GLM, MiniMax, Kimi, LongCat, DeepSeek, etc.](#alternative-model-combinations) — no Claude or OpenAI API required
- 🛑 **Human-in-the-loop** — configurable checkpoints at key decisions. `AUTO_PROCEED=true` for full autopilot, `false` to approve each step
- 📱 **[Feishu/Lark notifications](docs/integrations/FEISHU.md)** — three modes: **off (default, recommended)**, push-only (webhook → mobile), interactive (approve/reject in Feishu). Zero impact when off

## 5. 📈 Score Progression (Real Run)

A real overnight 4-round run on an ML research project — the AI reviewer's score climbed **5.0/10 (borderline reject) → 7.5/10 (review-ready)** as the loop autonomously ran **20+ GPU experiments**, rewrote the narrative framing, and killed claims that didn't hold up, all without human intervention.

<details>
<summary>Round-by-round breakdown</summary>

| Round | Score | What Happened |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Initial | 5.0/10 | Borderline reject |
| Round 1 | 6.5/10 | Added standard metrics, discovered metric decoupling |
| Round 2 | 6.8/10 | Key claim failed to reproduce, pivoted narrative |
| Round 3 | 7.0/10 | Large seed study killed main improvement claim |
| Round 4 | **7.5/10** ✅ | Diagnostic evidence solidified, **submission ready** |

## 6. 🏆 Community Showcase — Papers Built with ARIS

Real projects that used the full ARIS pipeline end-to-end. **The scores listed are AI-review signals ([CSPaper](https://cspaper.org/) / [Stanford Agentic Reviewer](https://paperreview.ai/)), not venue acceptances** — and since ARIS optimizes *through* AI-review loops, high AI scores are an expected byproduct, not proof of acceptance (human reviewers still bring literature / venue / community judgment an AI reviewer misses). **Used ARIS for a paper? Open an issue / PR to be featured!**

<details>
<summary>Papers + their AI-review signals (3)</summary>

The quote is from CSPaper's simulated review, not an official venue review. |
| **AAAI 2026 Paper Submission** | [Stanford Agentic Reviewer](https://paperreview.ai/) **7/10** — AI reviewer recommendation: "Good paper, accept" | Submitted to AAAI 2026 Main Technical; awaiting official decision | [@xinbo820-web](https://github.com/xinbo820-web) | Pure **Codex CLI** (ARIS-Codex skills). The 7/10 signal comes from an AAAI-style Stanford Agentic Reviewer run, not an official AAAI acceptance result. |

## 8. 🔄 Workflows

These skills compose into a full research lifecycle. Each workflow can be used independently or chained together:

- **Exploring a new area (e.g., writing a survey)?** Start with Workflow 1 → `/idea-discovery`
- **Have a plan, need to implement and run?** Workflow 1.5 → `/experiment-bridge`
- **Already have results, need iterative improvement?** Workflow 2 → `/auto-review-loop`
- **Ready to write the paper?** Workflow 3 → `/paper-writing` (or step by step: `/paper-plan` → `/paper-figure` → `/paper-write` → `/paper-compile` → `/auto-paper-improvement-loop`)
- **Got reviews back? Need to rebuttal?** Workflow 4 → `/rebuttal` — parse reviews, draft safe rebuttal, follow-up rounds
- **Full pipeline?** Workflow 1 → 1.5 → 2 → 3 → submit → 4 → `/research-pipeline` + `/rebuttal` — from idea through submission and rebuttal
- **Want ARIS to remember and learn?** 📚 `/research-wiki init` — persistent memory across sessions. Papers, ideas, failed experiments compound over time
- **Want ARIS to improve itself?** Workflow M → `/meta-optimize` — analyze usage logs, propose skill improvements, reviewer-gated

> ⚠️ **Important:** These tools accelerate research, but they don't replace your own critical thinking. Always review generated ideas with your domain expertise, question the assumptions, and make the final call yourself. The best research comes from human insight + AI execution, not full autopilot.

### Workflow 1: Idea Discovery & Method Refinement 🔍

> **"What's the state of the art? Where are the gaps? How do we solve it?"**

Don't have a concrete idea yet? Just give a research direction — `/idea-discovery` handles the rest:

1. 📚 **Survey** the landscape (recent papers, open problems, recurring limitations)
2. 🧠 **Brainstorm** 8-12 concrete ideas via GPT-5.5 xhigh
3. 🔍 **Filter** by feasibility, compute cost, and quick novelty search
4. 🛡️ **Validate** top ideas with deep novelty check + devil's advocate review
5. 🧪 **Pilot** top 2-3 ideas in parallel on different GPUs (30 min - 2 hr each)
6. 🏆 **Rank** by empirical signal — ideas with positive pilot results rise to the top
7. 🔬 **Refine** the top idea into a problem-anchored proposal via iterative GPT-5.5 review
8. 🧪 **Plan** claim-driven experiments with ablations, budgets, and run order

The output is a ranked `IDEA_REPORT.md` plus a refined proposal (`refine-logs/FINAL_PROPOSAL.md`) and experiment plan (`refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`) for the top idea. Dead-end ideas are documented too, saving future exploration.

### Workflow 1.5: Experiment Bridge 🔗

> **"I have a plan. Now implement it, deploy it, and get me initial results."**

Already have an experiment plan (from Workflow 1 or your own)? `/experiment-bridge` turns it into running code:

1. 📋 **Parse** the experiment plan (`refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`)
2. 💻 **Implement** experiment scripts (reuse existing code, add proper argparse/logging/seeds)
3. 🔍 **GPT-5.5 code review** — cross-model review catches logic bugs before wasting GPU hours (`code review: true` by default)
4. ✅ **Sanity check** — run the smallest experiment first to catch runtime bugs
5. 🚀 **Deploy** full experiment suite to GPU via `/run-experiment`
6. 📊 **Collect** initial results and update the experiment tracker

### Workflow 2: Auto Research Loop 🔁 (sleep & wake up to results)

> **"Review my paper, fix what's wrong, repeat until it's good."**
>
> GPT-5.5 reviews → identifies weaknesses → suggests experiments → Claude Code writes scripts, deploys to GPU, monitors results, rewrites the paper — all while you sleep. Just add your [GPU server config](#gpu-server-setup) to `CLAUDE.md`.

1. 🔍 **Deep review** — GPT-5.5 xhigh reviews the current paper / claims / experiments and identifies weaknesses
2. 🩹 **Fix** — Claude implements the fixes (rewrites sections, adds baselines, or runs new experiments via `/run-experiment`); skips any experiment estimated > 4 GPU-hours and flags it for manual follow-up
3. 📊 **Re-evaluate** — collect results via `/monitor-experiment`, update paper, feed back to the reviewer
4. 🔁 **Repeat** — until score ≥ `POSITIVE_THRESHOLD` (default 6/10) or `MAX_ROUNDS` (default 4) is hit; if context window fills mid-loop, the workflow auto-resumes from `REVIEW_STATE.json`

<details>
<summary><b>Show W2 usage examples, reviewer difficulty levels, and full safety guarantees</b> — topic/scope arguments, medium/hard/nightmare, 6 safety rules</summary>

**What to pass as argument?** A short topic or scope is enough — the skill automatically reads your project's narrative docs (`NARRATIVE_REPORT.md`), memory files, experiment results, and prior reviews to build the full context for GPT-5.5. Examples:
- `/auto-review-loop "factorized gap in discrete diffusion LMs"` — broad topic, skill finds everything
- `/auto-review-loop "focus on Section 3-5, our CRF results are weak"` — targeted scope with hints
- `/auto-review-loop` — also works: skill reads project files and infers the topic

**🎮 Reviewer Difficulty** — control how adversarial the reviewer is:

| Level | What changes | Use when |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `medium` (default) | Standard MCP review — same as before | Normal workflow |
| `hard` | + Reviewer Memory (GPT tracks suspicions across rounds) + Debate Protocol (Claude rebuts, GPT rules) | Want tougher feedback |
| `nightmare` | + GPT reads repo directly via `codex exec` (Claude can't filter what it sees) + adversarial verification | Preparing for top venue, want maximum stress test |

```bash
/auto-review-loop "topic" — difficulty: nightmare    # GPT reads your code and verifies claims itself
```

**🛡️ Key safety features:**

- 🔒 **MAX_ROUNDS = 4** — prevents infinite loops; stops early if score threshold is met
- ⏱️ **> 4 GPU-hour experiments skipped** — won't launch massive jobs; flags them for manual follow-up
- 🧠 **Prefer reframing over new experiments** — when both can address a weakness, chooses the cheaper path
- 🪞 **No hiding weaknesses** — explicit rule: "Do NOT hide weaknesses to game a positive score"
- 🔧 **Fix before re-review** — must actually implement fixes before resubmitting; no empty promises
- 💾 **Compact recovery** — persists state (`REVIEW_STATE.json`) after each round. If the context window fills up and auto-compacts mid-loop, the workflow reads the state file and resumes from where it left off — no human intervention needed

1. 📝 **Narrate** — write `NARRATIVE_REPORT.md` (claims, experiments, results, figure descriptions); see [`templates/NARRATIVE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/NARRATIVE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md)
2. 🧭 **Plan** — `/paper-plan` builds the claims-evidence matrix + section plan
3. 📊 **Figures** — `/paper-figure` generates data-driven plots and comparison tables from JSON/CSV
4. ✍️ **Write** — `/paper-write` produces section-by-section LaTeX
5. 🔧 **Compile** — `/paper-compile` builds the PDF, fixes errors, runs the page-limit check
6. ✨ **Improve** — `/auto-paper-improvement-loop` runs 2 rounds of GPT-5.5 content review + final format check

**Skills involved:** `paper-plan` + `paper-figure` + `paper-write` + `paper-compile` + `auto-paper-improvement-loop` + (post-acceptance) `paper-poster-html` + `paper-slides`

> **One-command shortcut:** `/paper-writing "NARRATIVE_REPORT.md"` runs this entire workflow automatically.

**Input:** A `NARRATIVE_REPORT.md` describing the research: claims, experiments, results, figures. The more detailed the narrative (especially figure descriptions and quantitative results), the better the output.

**Output:** A `paper/` directory with LaTeX source, clean `.bib` (only cited entries), and compiled PDF. The PDF is labelled `submission-ready` **only when** run at `— effort: max | beast` (or explicit `— assurance: submission`) **and** `tools/verify_paper_audits.sh` reports green on the three mandatory audits (`proof-checker`, `paper-claim-audit`, `citation-audit`); see [Assurance Gate](#assurance-gate-effort-max--beast) below. At the default `balanced` level, the output is a reviewed draft.

<details>
<summary><b>Show W3 feature details</b> — Claims-Evidence Matrix, figure modes, clean bib, Gemini API setup, ICLR end-to-end test</summary>

**Key features:**
- 📐 **Claims-Evidence Matrix** — every claim maps to evidence, every experiment supports a claim
- 📊 **Auto figure generation** — line plots, bar charts, comparison tables from JSON data
- 🧹 **Clean bib** — automated filtering removes uncited entries (948→215 lines in testing). Real BibTeX from [DBLP](https://dblp.org)/[CrossRef](https://www.crossref.org) instead of LLM-generated entries
- 📄 **Flexible sections** — 5-8 sections depending on paper type (theory papers often need 7)
- 🔍 **GPT-5.5 review** — each step optionally reviewed by external LLM
- ✂️ **De-AI polish** — removes AI writing patterns (delve, pivotal, landscape...)
- 🎯 **Page verification** — `pdftotext`-based precise check that main body fits page limit

> ⚠️ **Figure generation scope:** `/paper-figure` auto-generates **data-driven plots** (training curves, bar charts, heatmaps) and **comparison tables** from JSON/CSV. For **architecture diagrams and method figures**: `illustration: gemini` (default) uses Claude→Gemini→Nano Banana Pro for publication-quality diagrams; `illustration: mermaid` generates Mermaid diagrams for free; `illustration: false` skips AI figures entirely.
>
> **Gemini API setup** (for `illustration: gemini`): Get your API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), then set it as an environment variable: `export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"`. Or add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc`). No other dependencies needed.

**Tested end-to-end:** Generated a 9-page ICLR 2026 theory paper (7 sections, 29 citations, 4 figures, 2 comparison tables) from a single NARRATIVE_REPORT.md — zero compilation errors, zero undefined references.

#### Auto Paper Improvement Loop ✨

After Workflow 3 generates the paper, `/auto-paper-improvement-loop` runs 2 rounds of GPT-5.5 xhigh content review → fix → recompile, plus a final format compliance check, autonomously polishing the paper from rough draft to a reviewer-scored draft. Whether the result is tagged `submission-ready` is decided separately by the Phase 6 assurance gate (see [Assurance Gate](#assurance-gate-effort-max--beast)).

<details>
<summary><b>Show auto-paper-improvement benchmark</b> — Score Progression on a real ICLR 2026 theory paper (4/10 → 8.5/10), plus Round 1/2/3 fix details</summary>

**Score Progression (Real Test — ICLR 2026 theory paper):**

| Round | Score | Key Changes |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Round 0 | 4/10 (content) | Baseline |
| Round 1 | 6/10 (content) | Fixed assumptions, softened claims, renamed notation |
| Round 2 | 7/10 (content) | Added synthetic validation, stronger limitations |
| Round 3 | 5→8.5/10 (format) | Removed hero fig, appendix, compressed conclusion, float spacing |

**Final: 8 pages main body (ICLR limit: 9), 0 overfull hbox, ICLR-compliant.** +4.5 points across 3 rounds.

<details>
<summary>Round 1 fixes (6 items)</summary>

1. **CRITICAL — Assumption-model mismatch**: A boundedness assumption contradicted the model's distributional family. Replaced with a tail-compatible assumption and added formal truncation bridge.
2. **CRITICAL — Theory-practice gap**: Theory assumes idealized encoders, experiments use learned nonlinear encoders. Softened "validate" → "demonstrate practical relevance" and added explicit disclaimer.
3. **MAJOR — Missing quantitative metrics**: Added parameter count table (latent vs total) with honest accounting of system cost.
4. **MAJOR — Theorem not self-contained**: Added "Interpretation" paragraph listing all dependencies explicitly.
5. **MAJOR — Overclaim in novelty statement**: Scoped a broad "first convergence guarantee" to precise conditions under which it holds.
6. **MAJOR — Notation confusion**: Renamed a symbol that clashed with another key variable. Added Notation paragraph.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Round 2 fixes (4 items)</summary>

1. **MAJOR — Missing theory-aligned experiments**: Added a synthetic validation subsection directly testing the two main theoretical predictions under controlled conditions.
2. **MAJOR — Overclaim softening**: Replaced strong equivalence claims with appropriately hedged language across all files.
3. **MAJOR — Informal theoretical argument**: Formalized an informal justification into a proper proposition with explicit error bounds.
4. **MINOR — Weak limitations**: Expanded to explicitly list all assumptions and acknowledge missing standard evaluations.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Round 3 format fixes (8 items)</summary>

1. Removed hero figure block (saved ~0.7 pages)
2. Compressed conclusion from 15→9 lines
3. Moved synthetic validation to Appendix A
4. Moved comparison tables to Appendix B
5. Fixed overfull hbox (85pt) with `\resizebox`
6. Added compact float spacing (`\captionsetup`, `\textfloatsep`)
7. Inlined centered question block in introduction
8. Tightened `itemize` environments

### Workflow 4: Rebuttal 📝 (reply to reviewers safely)

> **"Reviews are in. Help me draft a safe, grounded rebuttal."**

Got reviews back? `/rebuttal` parses them, builds a strategy, and drafts a venue-compliant response:

1. 📋 **Parse** — normalize reviews, validate venue rules (character limit, text-only, etc.)
2. 🔍 **Atomize** — split each review into issue cards (type, severity, reviewer stance)
3. 🗺️ **Strategize** — global themes, per-reviewer priorities, character budget, blocked claims
4. 🧪 **Evidence sprint** — if `auto experiment: true`, auto-run supplementary experiments via `/experiment-bridge`
5. ✍️ **Draft** — global opener + numbered per-reviewer responses + closing for meta-reviewer
6. 🛡️ **Safety check** — 6 lints: coverage, provenance, commitment, tone, consistency, limit
7. 🔬 **GPT-5.5 stress test** — internal skeptical review of the draft
8. 📄 **Finalize** — two outputs: `PASTE_READY.txt` (exact character count) + `REBUTTAL_DRAFT_rich.md` (extended version for manual editing)
9. 🔄 **Follow-up rounds** — delta replies for reviewer discussions, technically escalating

**Skills involved:** `rebuttal`

> 💡 **Quick mode:** `/rebuttal — quick mode: true` stops after parsing + strategy (Phase 0-3). See what reviewers want before committing to a full draft.

> ⚙️ `VENUE`, `AUTO_EXPERIMENT`, `QUICK_MODE`, `MAX_STRESS_TEST_ROUNDS` are configurable — see [Customization](#customization).

**Three safety gates — rebuttal will NOT finalize if any fails:**
- 🔒 **Provenance** — every claim maps to paper/review/user-confirmed result. No fabrication.
- 🔒 **Commitment** — every promise is user-approved. No overpromising.
- 🔒 **Coverage** — every reviewer concern is tracked. Nothing disappears.

### Workflow 5: Resubmit Pipeline 🔁 (port a paper to a new venue, text-only)

Port a polished paper from venue A → B under **hard, non-overridable guardrails** — no new experiments · no bib edits · no framework changes · never overwrites prior submissions — via physical isolation, a 5-layer anonymity check, soft-only audits, whitelist microedits, and a `/kill-argument` adversarial gate. **Full flow + constraints → [docs/RESUBMIT_AND_TALK.md](docs/RESUBMIT_AND_TALK.md)**

### Workflow 6: Conference Talk Pipeline 🎤 (paper → slides → polish → audits)

`/paper-talk` turns an accepted paper into a talk: outline → `/paper-slides` (Beamer + PPTX + speaker notes + Q&A) → `/slides-polish` (per-page Codex visual pass) → optional conference-ready audit gate. Sister to `/paper-writing` / `/paper-poster-html`. **Full flow → [docs/RESUBMIT_AND_TALK.md](docs/RESUBMIT_AND_TALK.md)**

### 📚 Research Wiki — Persistent Research Memory

> **"Stop re-deriving. Start compounding."** — inspired by [Karpathy's LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)

Without the wiki, ARIS is stateless — every `/idea-discovery` starts from scratch. With the wiki, ARIS accumulates knowledge across the entire research lifecycle: papers read, ideas tested, experiments run, claims verified or invalidated.

**The key insight:** failed ideas are the most valuable memory. A researcher who knows what doesn't work generates better ideas than one starting from zero.

**Setup:**
```
> /research-wiki init     # one-time, creates research-wiki/ in your project
```

**That's it.** Once initialized, the wiki works automatically.

<details>
<summary><b>Show the automatic wiki hooks</b> — what fires at /research-lit, /idea-creator, /result-to-claim, plus the re-ideation nudge</summary>

| When | What happens | Wiki action |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `/research-lit` finds papers | Papers auto-ingested | `papers/<slug>.md` created, edges added, query_pack rebuilt |
| `/idea-creator` runs | Reads wiki first | Failed ideas = banlist, gaps = search seeds, papers = known prior work |
| `/idea-creator` finishes | ALL ideas written back | Both recommended AND eliminated ideas → `ideas/<id>.md` |
| `/result-to-claim` judges | Results written back | Experiment page created, claim status updated (supported/invalidated) |
| 3+ ideas fail | Re-ideation suggested | "💡 Consider re-running /idea-creator — the wiki now knows what doesn't work" |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Show Research Wiki data model</b> — Paper / Idea / Experiment / Claim entities and the typed graph edges that connect them</summary>

**Four entity types:**

| Entity | What it stores | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| 📄 **Paper** | Structured summary: thesis, method, limitations, reusable ingredients | `paper:chen2025_factorized_gap` |
| 💡 **Idea** | Hypothesis, status (proposed/failed/succeeded), failure notes, lessons | `idea:001` |
| 🧪 **Experiment** | Metrics, verdict, hardware, duration | `exp:001` |
| 📋 **Claim** | Testable statement + evidence status (reported/supported/invalidated) | `claim:C1` |

**Typed relationships** (stored in `graph/edges.jsonl`):
```
paper --extends--> paper              idea --inspired_by--> paper
paper --contradicts--> paper          idea --tested_by--> experiment
paper --addresses_gap--> gap          experiment --supports--> claim

```

<details>
<summary><b>Show Research Wiki spiral-learning example and manual subcommands</b> — failed ideas → better ideas across 3 rounds; ingest / query / update / lint / stats</summary>

**Spiral learning in action:**
```
Round 1: read 15 papers → wiki remembers → idea A → experiment → FAIL
         wiki records: "A fails because OOM at batch>32, loss diverges"

Round 2: /idea-creator reads wiki → sees A failed → generates idea D (avoids A's trap)
         → experiment → PARTIAL SUCCESS
         wiki records: "D works on small models, fails on large"

Round 3: /idea-creator reads wiki → knows A failed + D partial → generates idea F
         (combines D's success with new approach) → experiment → SUCCESS 🎉
```

**Subcommands:**
```
/research-wiki init                              # initialize wiki
/research-wiki ingest "paper title" — arxiv: xxx  # manually add a paper
/research-wiki query "topic"                      # rebuild query_pack.md
/research-wiki update idea:001 — outcome: negative # update entity
/research-wiki lint                               # health check (orphans, contradictions, stale claims)
/research-wiki stats                              # overview (paper/idea/experiment/claim counts)
```

</details>

> 🔒 **Safe by design:** All workflow hooks are guarded by `if research-wiki/ exists`. No wiki = no impact. Zero dependencies (pure Python stdlib). You choose when to enable it.

### Workflow M: Meta-Optimize 🧬 (ARIS optimizes itself)

> **"Analyze my usage patterns and improve your own skills."**

Unlike Workflows 1–4 which optimize *research artifacts* (papers, code, experiments), Workflow M optimizes the *harness itself* — the SKILL.md instructions, default parameters, and convergence rules that govern how ARIS operates. Inspired by [Meta-Harness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.28052) (Lee et al., 2026).

<details>
<summary><b>Show Workflow M one-time setup and usage commands</b> — Claude Code hook install, /meta-optimize variants (project / per-skill / --global / apply)</summary>

**Setup (one-time, in normal terminal):**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude .aris/meta tools/meta_opt
cp Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/templates/claude-hooks/meta_logging.json .claude/settings.json
cp Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/tools/meta_opt/*.sh tools/meta_opt/
chmod +x tools/meta_opt/*.sh
claude   # hooks active immediately
```

**Usage (after 5+ workflow runs):**
```
> /meta-optimize                        # analyze current project
> /meta-optimize "auto-review-loop"     # focus on one skill
> /meta-optimize --global               # analyze trends across ALL projects
> /meta-optimize apply 1                # apply recommended change #1
```

</details>

**How it works:**

1. 📊 **Passive logging** — Claude Code hooks silently record every skill invocation, tool call, failure, parameter override, and user prompt. Events are written to **both** project-level (`.aris/meta/events.jsonl`) and global (`~/.aris/meta/events.jsonl`, with a `"project"` tag) logs. Zero user effort.
2. 🔍 **Pattern analysis** — `/meta-optimize` reads the log and identifies:
   - Parameters users override most often (bad defaults)
   - Tools that fail repeatedly in specific skills (missing error handling)
   - Review score plateaus (convergence rules too loose/tight)
   - Manual corrections users make (skill gaps)
3. 🩹 **Patch proposal** — generates minimal diffs to target SKILL.md files with data-backed justifications
4. 🔬 **Reviewer gate** — GPT-5.5 xhigh reviews each patch: does the evidence support it? could it hurt other users?
5. ✅ **User approval** — only applied with explicit user consent. All changes are logged and reversible.

**What gets optimized (harness components):**
| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Skill prompts | Reviewer instructions, quality gates, step descriptions |
| Default parameters | `difficulty`, `MAX_ROUNDS`, `threshold` |
| Convergence rules | When to stop the review loop, retry counts |
| Error handling | Auto-debug patterns, failure recovery steps |

</details>

**What does NOT get optimized:** research artifacts (papers, code, experiments) — that's what W1–W4 do.

**Skills involved:** `meta-optimize`

> 💡 This is a **maintenance workflow**, not part of the W1→W1.5→W2→W3→W4 research pipeline. Run it periodically, like `git gc` for your research harness.

### ⚡ Effort Levels

Every skill takes `— effort: lite | balanced | max | beast` — scaling breadth/depth (papers · ideas · pilots · rounds · seeds · audit depth) from ~0.4× to ~5–8×; **`balanced` is the default** (zero change for existing users). What **never** changes at any level: Codex reasoning stays `xhigh`, DBLP/CrossRef citations on, reviewer independence on, experiment integrity on. **📖 Full spec + per-skill counts → [`effort-contract.md`](skills/shared-references/effort-contract.md)**

### Assurance Gate (effort: max | beast)

A second axis, orthogonal to effort: **assurance** decides whether mandatory audits are load-bearing. `lite`/`balanced` ⇒ `draft` (audits non-blocking — current behavior, zero change); `max`/`beast` ⇒ `submission` (paper-writing Phase 6 force-runs `/proof-checker` + `/paper-claim-audit` + `/citation-audit` in fresh threads and refuses the Final Report if `tools/verify_paper_audits.sh` exits non-zero). Escape hatch: `— effort: beast, assurance: draft`. **📖 Full spec → [`assurance-contract.md`](skills/shared-references/assurance-contract.md)**

<a id="-optional-gpt-54-pro-via-oracle"></a>

### 🧿 Optional: GPT-5.5 Pro via Oracle

Add `— reviewer: oracle-pro` to any reviewer-aware skill (`/proof-checker`, `/research-review`, `/experiment-audit`, `/rebuttal`, …) to route review through **GPT-5.5 Pro** — strongest reasoning for deep proof / code / experiment-design critique. Default stays Codex xhigh; Oracle not installed ⇒ graceful fallback + warning (zero impact). **📖 Setup + per-skill examples → [`reviewer-routing.md`](skills/shared-references/reviewer-routing.md)**

## 9. ⚙️ Setup

> 📖 **New to ARIS?** [`SETUP_GUIDE.md`](SETUP_GUIDE.md) ([中文](SETUP_GUIDE_CN.md)) gives a prescriptive 6-step walkthrough for macOS local + remote Linux GPU server with Claude Code + Codex MCP — the recommended path. The section below is a quick reference; deeper GPU / customization / model-combo setup lives in the linked docs.

<a id="prerequisites"></a>

### 10.1 Prerequisites

1. [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
2. (For review skills) [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and configured as MCP server:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @openai/codex
   claude mcp add codex -s user -- codex mcp-server
   ```
3. (For Workflow 3: paper writing) **LaTeX** environment with `latexmk` and `pdfinfo`:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install --cask mactex    # or: brew install basictex
   brew install poppler          # provides pdfinfo

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install texlive-full latexmk poppler-utils

   # Verify
   latexmk --version && pdfinfo -v
   ```
   > If you only need Workflow 1 & 2 (idea discovery + auto review), LaTeX is not required.

<a id="install-skills"></a>

### 10.2 Install Skills

> 💡 **Recommended: project-local flat symlink install** (since 2026-04-20). Each ARIS skill is symlinked individually into `.claude/skills/<skill-name>`, so Claude Code's slash-command discovery picks them up. A manifest at `.aris/installed-skills.txt` tracks what ARIS installed — uninstall and reconcile only ever touch managed entries, never your own skills.
>
> 🤖 **Codex mirror route:** keep Claude on `install_aris.sh` / `smart_update.sh`. For Codex-native project installs, use `install_aris_codex.sh`; for copied Codex installs, use `smart_update_codex.sh`.

```bash
# 1. Clone ARIS once to a stable location
git clone https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep.git ~/aris_repo

# 2. For each project that uses ARIS, attach via symlinks:
cd ~/your-paper-project
bash ~/aris_repo/tools/install_aris.sh
# → creates one symlink per skill: .claude/skills/<skill> → ~/aris_repo/skills/<skill>
# → writes manifest .aris/installed-skills.txt (tracks every entry ARIS installed)
# → updates managed CLAUDE.md ARIS block (best-effort, compare-and-swap)
# → re-runnable: rerun anytime to reconcile new/removed upstream skills

# 3. To update existing skills' content for ALL attached projects:
cd ~/aris_repo && git pull   # symlinks resolve to live upstream — content updates automatically

# 3a. To pick up newly added or removed upstream skills, rerun the installer:
bash ~/aris_repo/tools/install_aris.sh ~/your-paper-project   # adds new symlinks, removes broken ones

# Other useful flags:
bash ~/aris_repo/tools/install_aris.sh --dry-run        # show plan, no changes
bash ~/aris_repo/tools/install_aris.sh --uninstall      # remove only managed symlinks (per manifest)
bash ~/aris_repo/tools/install_aris.sh --from-old       # migrate from old nested .claude/skills/aris/

# Windows (PowerShell, no WSL required; creates flat per-skill junctions):
.\tools\install_aris.ps1 C:\path\to\your-paper-project -Platform claude
.\tools\install_aris.ps1 C:\path\to\your-codex-project -Platform codex
```

**Why "git pull" alone isn't enough for new/removed skills:** the flat layout uses one symlink per skill, so upstream additions/deletions don't propagate until the installer is re-run. The trade-off bought us Claude Code's automatic slash-command discovery (which only scans one directory level deep).

<details>
<summary><b>Migrating from the old nested install (pre-2026-04-20)</b></summary>

If you previously installed via `install_aris.sh` (which created `.claude/skills/aris/` as a single nested symlink) or via `smart_update.sh --target-subdir .claude/skills/aris`, your slash commands probably weren't being auto-discovered by Claude Code. Migrate to the flat layout:

```bash
# Symlink-style legacy install:
bash ~/aris_repo/tools/install_aris.sh ~/your-project --from-old

# Copy-style legacy install (with possible local edits — chose strategy explicitly):
bash ~/aris_repo/tools/install_aris.sh ~/your-project --from-old --migrate-copy keep-user
#   → keeps your nested .claude/skills/aris/ copy intact alongside the new flat install
bash ~/aris_repo/tools/install_aris.sh ~/your-project --from-old --migrate-copy prefer-upstream
#   → archives nested copy to .aris/legacy-copy-backup-<timestamp>/, then flattens
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative installs (advanced)</b></summary>

**Project-local copy (no symlinks, useful for per-project skill edits):**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/your-project/.claude/skills
bash ~/aris_repo/tools/smart_update.sh --project ~/your-project --apply
# Default --target-subdir is .claude/skills (flat), which is what Claude Code expects.
# (The old --target-subdir .claude/skills/aris is now deprecated — see migration block above.)
```

**Global install (one copy in your home dir, available to every project):**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r ~/aris_repo/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
# Update with: bash tools/smart_update.sh --apply
```

> Global install increases the risk of skill name collisions with other globally-installed packs. Use only if you don't mix ARIS with Superpowers / OpenHands / etc. — otherwise prefer the project-local install above.

</details>

> 💡 **New Claude Code versions** may not auto-create `~/.claude/skills/`. If using global install, create it first: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/`. The symlink installer handles directory creation automatically.

<a id="optional-codex-plugin-for-code-review"></a>

<details>
<summary><b>Optional: Codex Plugin for Code Review</b></summary>

[codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc) provides additional Codex capabilities that ARIS auto-detects when installed:

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc
/plugin install codex@openai-codex
/reload-plugins
/codex:setup
```

**Where ARIS uses the plugin:**

| Skill | Workflow | What it does |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `/codex:review` | Workflow 1.5 | Review experiment code before GPU deployment |
| `/codex:adversarial-review` | Workflow 1.5 | Adversarial code review (find edge cases, bugs) |
| `/codex:rescue` | Workflow 1.5 + 3 | **Auto-debug rescue** — when experiment or LaTeX compilation fails after 2 attempts, Codex independently diagnoses the root cause before the next retry |

All plugin features are **optional** — if not installed, ARIS falls back to Claude's own diagnosis. The plugin just adds a second pair of eyes.

> Note: ARIS's core cross-model review (paper scoring, idea evaluation, rebuttal stress test) still uses Codex MCP, which allows custom prompts. The plugin cannot replace this.

### 10.3 Update Skills

```bash
cd Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep
git pull

# 🧠 Smart update (recommended) — analyzes what's safe to update
bash tools/smart_update.sh          # dry-run: shows what would change
bash tools/smart_update.sh --apply  # apply: adds new + updates safe ones

# Manual options (if you prefer):
# cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/       # Option A: overwrite all
# cp -rn skills/* ~/.claude/skills/      # Option B: only add new, keep yours
# cp -r skills/experiment-bridge ~/.claude/skills/  # Option C: specific skill
```

> 💡 **Smart update** compares your local skills with upstream, detects personal customizations (server paths, API keys, etc.), and only updates skills that are safe to replace. Skills with your personal info are flagged for manual review.

### 10.4 Usage

```
# Workflow 1: Idea Discovery
> /idea-discovery "your research direction"          # full pipeline
> /research-lit "topic"                              # just literature survey (all sources)

```

### 10.5 🌙 Auto-Allow for Overnight Runs (Optional)

<details>
<summary>Skip permission prompts on overnight runs — add a snippet to <code>.claude/settings.local.json</code></summary>

To run the auto-review loop without clicking permission prompts, add to `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__codex__codex",
      "mcp__codex__codex-reply",
      "Write",
      "Edit",
      "Skill(auto-review-loop)"
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

<a id="gpu-server-setup"></a>

### 🖥️ GPU for Auto-Experiments (Optional)

When the reviewer says "run an ablation", Claude Code writes the script and runs it on your GPU — you just declare your server in `CLAUDE.md`. Three modes (**Remote SSH** · **Local GPU** · **Vast.ai on-demand**): config snippets + setup → **[docs/GPU_SETUP.md](docs/GPU_SETUP.md)** (Vast.ai deep-dive → **[Vast.ai guide](docs/integrations/VAST_GPU_GUIDE.md)**). No GPU? Review/rewrite skills still work; experiment fixes are flagged for manual follow-up.

### 🔌 Integrations (Optional)

Plug your library / vault / notifications into ARIS — each auto-skips silently if unconfigured:

- **[Zotero](docs/integrations/ZOTERO.md)** — collections + annotations + BibTeX in `/research-lit` (before web search).
- **[Obsidian + arXiv](docs/integrations/OBSIDIAN.md)** — search your vault notes; arXiv is built-in, no setup.
- **[Feishu / Lark](docs/integrations/FEISHU.md)** — mobile push + interactive approve/reject for overnight runs.

## 10. 🎛️ Customization

Skills are plain Markdown — fork and tune them. Per-skill environment variables (GPU target, code review, reviewer routing, human checkpoints, paper-writing knobs) and parameter pass-through live in **[docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md)**.

<a id="alternative-model-combinations"></a>

## 11. 🔀 Alternative Model Combinations

<a id="alt-a-glm--gpt"></a>

No Claude / OpenAI API? Swap in other providers — same cross-model architecture. ARIS ships **10 alternative routes** (Z.ai GLM, Alibaba Kimi/Qwen/MiniMax, free DeepSeek-V3.1 via ModelScope, OpenRouter as a pin-one-of-many reviewer backend, Codex-as-executor with Claude/Gemini reviewers, Google Antigravity). Full routing table + per-route setup in **[docs/MODEL_COMBINATIONS.md](docs/MODEL_COMBINATIONS.md)**.
